# Prospect Experience Design (PX) Report: A Detailed Synthesis with References

## Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed synthesis of the Prospect Experience Design (PX) methodology, a comprehensive framework for creating high-performance, lead-generation websites for expert firms, based on the collected articles in the `px-resources` folder.

The core philosophy of PX is a strategic shift from traditional User Experience (UX). While UX aims to help users accomplish their own goals, **PX is designed to guide specific users (prospects) through a specific set of actions that you define**, ultimately graduating them from passive researchers into qualified business opportunities. This is a deliberate act of control, designed to create predictable and desirable prospect behavior rather than simply observing it.

The methodology is built upon a structured information architecture of seven critical page types, a disciplined approach to page layout that mandates a single **primary action** for every page, and a system of **progressive engagement** to nurture leads effectively. This system values clarity over creativity, accountability over aesthetics, and focuses on what is **true** about your business over what is **new**.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Prospect Experience (PX) vs. User Experience (UX)

The foundational concept is the distinction between PX and UX, which dictates the entire approach to website design.

*   **User Experience (UX):** Enhances user satisfaction by improving usability and accessibility for a general audience. It's about letting users do what *they* want to do efficiently.
*   **Prospect Experience (PX):** Is unapologetically focused on marketing and sales goals. It's about making it easy for *prospects* to do what *you* want them to do. It recognizes that for a marketing website, not all users are created equal; the focus must be on those who could become clients.

This core difference is best summarized in `marketing-website-layout-design-newfangled.md`, which states: "Good UX makes it easy for users to do what *they* want to do... Good PX, on the other hand, makes it easy for prospects to do what *you* need them to do."

**The Three Pillars of PX (Source: `introduction-prospect-experience-design-newfangled.md`):**
1.  **Address Specific Users:** Design for your ideal prospects, not a general audience. This requires a deep understanding of who they are and what they need to learn to understand your value.
2.  **Encourage Specific Interactions:** Every page must have a single, clear **primary action**. This is the most important thing you want a prospect to do on that page. This controversial principle is the core of the methodology, forcing clarity of purpose on every page and reducing options to guide prospects purposefully. Secondary actions (1-3 per page) offer alternatives for those not ready to proceed.
3.  **Expect Specific Outcomes:** The goal is to create a purposeful, predictable flow that moves prospects through the buying cycle, from researcher to evaluator to qualified buyer. Prospect behavior isn't predicted; it's designed.

## 2. The 7 Critical Pages of a Lead-Generation Website

The PX methodology is built around a specific Information Architecture (IA) consisting of seven essential page templates, divided into two categories. This structure is the "marketing engine" of the website.

*(Source: `lead-generation-information-architecture-newfangled.md`)*

### 2.1. Positioning Pages
These pages explain the `why` and `how` of your business. They are designed to be consumed sequentially as part of a **Purposeful User Flow**, creating an intentional journey from initial interest to direct contact.

1.  **Home Page:** The central orientation point.
2.  **Capabilities Landing Page:** The elaboration of your firm's mission and structure.
3.  **Service Landing Pages:** The details of your specific offerings.
4.  **Case Studies:** The proof of your value and results.

**The Purposeful User Flow (Source: `purposeful-user-flows-newfangled.md`):** A prospect often enters the site on an Article Page, gets interested, and navigates to the **Home Page** to understand the source (this is called the "Orientation Pattern"). From there, the primary actions are designed to guide them sequentially: **Home → Capabilities → Service → Case Study**, with the final step being a direct, buyer-friendly call to action.

### 2.2. Content Marketing Pages
These pages attract prospects through expertise and are the most common entry points to the site.

5.  **Content Hub:** The central, filterable portal for all your expert content.
6.  **Article Pages:** The workhorses of content marketing, where expertise is demonstrated.
7.  **Gated Content:** A mechanism for lead capture in exchange for high-value content.

## 3. Page-Specific Layouts and Strategies

Each of the seven critical pages has a specific job and a recommended layout optimized for its role in the prospect's journey.

### 3.1. Home Page
*   **Job:** To orient visitors who have landed elsewhere on your site (the "Orientation Pattern") and guide them into the positioning flow. It's for first impressions, not for returning visitors or for sharing news.
*   **Mantra:** Focus on what is **true**, not what is **new**.
*   **Layout (in strict priority order):**
    1.  **What You Do:** A clear, concise positioning statement.
        *   **Primary Action:** A single, prominent button to the `Capabilities Page`.
    2.  **What You've Done:** 1-2 of your best, most relevant case studies.
    3.  **What Your Clients Say:** A powerful testimonial (social proof).
    4.  **What You Say:** Links to your latest expert content (this is the lowest priority).

### 3.2. Capabilities Landing Page
*   **Job:** To bridge the gap between your high-level positioning and your specific services. It explains the purpose of the firm.
*   **Layout:**
    1.  **Simple Name:** Use "What We Do" or "Capabilities," not internal jargon.
    2.  **Brief Content (~100-250 words):** Elaborate on your firm's mission and general approach.
    3.  **Client Testimonial:** Social proof for your overall value.
    4.  **Scannable List of Services:** A list of the discrete disciplines or solutions you offer.
        *   **Primary Action:** Click on a service to learn more.
    5.  **Buyer-Friendly CTA:** A secondary option for prospects ready to engage directly.

### 3.3. Service Landing Page
*   **Job:** To explain a specific service, focusing on the problems it solves and the outcomes it delivers. It's a pitch, not a manual.
*   **Service Definition:** A "service" is an element of your business that solves a unique problem, in a unique way, that requires unique actions of your client, and measures success in unique ways. It's what you put on an invoice, whereas a "capability" is what you put in a project management app.
*   **Layout:**
    1.  **Brief Content (~250 words):** Explain the problem, your method, and how success is measured.
    2.  **Service-Specific Testimonial:** Social proof directly related to this service.
    3.  **Scannable List of Related Case Studies:** Provide proof of application.
        *   **Primary Action:** Click on a case study to see proof.
    4.  **Buyer-Friendly CTA:** A secondary "off-ramp" for ready buyers.

### 3.4. Case Study Page
*   **Job:** To prove your value and serve as the final step in the positioning flow. The goal is to generate leads.
*   **Focus:** **Impact and results**, not a detailed process narrative. Prospects buy outcomes, not processes.
*   **Three Ways Prospects Consume (Source: `three-ways-case-studies-consumed-newfangled.md`):**
    1.  **Readers:** Will read the full narrative. Keep it concise (~500 words).
    2.  **Scanners:** Most prospects will scan. Use highly specific headlines (e.g., "Integrated Cross-Channel Campaigns" instead of "Solution") and make visual elements like stats and pull quotes stand alone.
    3.  **Searchers:** Use solution-focused titles (e.g., "Social Media Strategy for Non-Profits") rather than client-focused titles ("Our Work for UNICEF") to attract the right audience.
*   **Layout:**
    1.  **Impact-Focused Content (~500+ words):** Frame the story around Problem -> Solution -> **Results**.
    2.  **Client Testimonial.**
    3.  **List of Related Services:** Critically, link to *services*, not other case studies, to prevent a "content cul-de-sac" and move the prospect from research to a business conversation.
    4.  **Buyer-Friendly CTA:**
        *   **Primary Action:** "Let's Talk," "Request a Meeting," etc.

### 3.5. Content Hub
*   **Job:** To be an efficient "information desk," not a lingering "lobby." It helps prospects quickly find relevant expertise.
*   **Layout (Dogmatic Three-Column Structure):**
    *   **Left Column:** Tools (e.g., additive filters for topic, content type, author). Users expect tools on the left.
    *   **Center Column:** A single-column, reverse-chronological list of all content for easy scanning. Grid layouts are discouraged as they require more cognitive load.
    *   **Right Column:** Contextual information and Calls-to-Action (CTAs). Users expect related info and ads on the right.
*   **CTA Strategy:** Place CTAs in the right sidebar (for quick "horizontal" browsers who don't scroll) and inline with the content list (for engaged "vertical" scrollers).
*(Source: `content-marketing-hub-layout-newfangled.md`)*

### 3.6. Article Page
*   **Job:** To serve as the primary entry point to the site by delivering valuable, discoverable expertise. This is the simplest but most important page type.
*   **Layout:**
    1.  **Substantial Content (500+ words):** SEO demands text. This is where you prove authority.
    2.  **List of 3-5 Related Articles:** Affirms your positioning and encourages deeper engagement, helping answer the prospect's question, "Is this *website* really about what I'm looking for?"
    3.  **Researcher/Evaluator CTAs:** Place 2-3 CTAs (e.g., "Subscribe," "Download Whitepaper") in the right sidebar where users expect to find them.

## 4. Key Supporting Systems & Concepts

### 4.1. Copywriting for Positioning
Your message must be **Clear, Visible, and Indexable**.
*   **Clarity:** Start with the "Mad Libs" formula: **"We do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."** The rule is to be *informative first, evocative second*.
*   **Visibility:** Use a tagline (5-6 words) in the header of *every page* so prospects landing on deep content can immediately understand context.
*   **Indexability:** Ensure all positioning copy is crawlable HTML text, not embedded in images.
*(Source: `copywriting-for-positioning-newfangled.md`)*

### 4.2. Progressive Engagement
This is the technology and design system for nurturing leads.
*   **Core Principle:** The system should always show the *next best* engagement opportunity based on a prospect's history. It never asks for information it already has.
*   **The 5 Engagement Points:**
    1.  **Smart CTAs:** Sidebar widgets that cycle automatically based on user history.
    2.  **Content Gates:** Forms that require information to access high-value content.
    3.  **Opportunity Forms:** Direct "Let's Talk" style forms for buyers, placed in the flow of positioning pages.
    4.  **Repeating Inline CTAs:** CTAs that appear within a long content list (like on the Content Hub).
    5.  **Calculators & Assessments:** Interactive tools for self-qualification.

### 4.3. Content Strategy Principles
*   **Novel, Specific, Profound:** To break through the noise, content ideas must be fresh, detailed, and have a strong, unique point of view. Generic content is forgettable. *(Source: `fighting-chance.md`)*
*   **SEO for Humans:** Write for your audience first, not for Google. The algorithm is increasingly sophisticated at understanding user intent. Over-optimizing with keywords, excessive links, or irrelevant images alienates the human reader. *(Source: `seo-strategies.md`)*
*   **Content Design:** The creation of visual components (hero images, ad creatives, email templates) is an ongoing process that is as important as the writing itself. It requires a flexible system to maintain brand consistency and support agile marketing campaigns. *(Source: `content-design.md`)*

## 5. Conclusion: Principles for Accountable Design

*   **Balance Creativity and Utility:** The author uses a powerful metaphor: Content is the "food." The website is the "pots and pans," and creativity is the "seasoning." Creativity must support and enhance the content, not obscure or compete with it. *(Source: `website-design-accountability-newfangled.md`)*
*   **Design for Accountability:** The PX framework provides a system to hold design decisions accountable to strategic marketing goals, preventing the common pattern of forgetting objectives once creative work begins. *(Source: `website-design-accountability-newfangled.md`)*
*   **Bridge the Gap:** Effective lead development requires synthesizing design, marketing, and sales. Designers must understand the business reality, and marketers must understand their reliance on good design. *(Source: `designing-better-lead-development-newfangled.md`)*
