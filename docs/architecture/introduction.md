# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **CCM Website**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack for the content skeleton and data piping system enhancement.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this Nuxt 3-based static site generation project where content management and presentation concerns are tightly integrated.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Analysis**: Brownfield project based on Nuxt 3 template with custom enhancements.

**Current Foundation**: The project is built on a Nuxt 3 starter template but has been significantly customized with:
- Custom CSS layer architecture (reset, defaults, utils, overrides)
- Component-based architecture with ccm prefix naming convention
- Nuxt Content integration for file-based CMS
- Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Server-side rendering configuration (SSR enabled) â†’ **Changing to SSG**

**Architectural Constraints from Existing Codebase**:
- Must preserve existing ccm component naming and CSS class structures
- Must integrate with current CSS layer methodology
- Must work with existing Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Must maintain compatibility with Nuxt Content file structure

**Enhancement Approach**: The PRD defines this as a "Brownfield Enhancement" to add content skeleton and data piping capabilities while preserving all existing architectural decisions and component structures.
