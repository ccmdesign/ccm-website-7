# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com`
- XSS Prevention: Static generation eliminates XSS vectors, content sanitization during markdown processing
- Secure Storage: No client-side data storage required, all content embedded in static HTML

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Markdown content validation during build process with schema enforcement
- Rate Limiting: Not applicable (static site with no runtime APIs)
- CORS Policy: Not required (no API endpoints, static file serving only)

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Not required (no user authentication system)
- Session Management: Not applicable (static site)
- Password Policy: Not required (content management through Git)

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 100KB JavaScript, < 50KB CSS (excluding content)
- Loading Strategy: Static HTML with progressive enhancement, critical CSS inlined
- Caching Strategy: Aggressive CDN caching (1 year static assets, 1 hour HTML)

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 100ms (CDN edge response time)
- Database Optimization: Not applicable (file-based content)
- Caching Strategy: Perfect caching through static generation, build-time optimization
