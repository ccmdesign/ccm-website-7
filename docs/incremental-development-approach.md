# Incremental Component Development Approach

## Philosophy: Build What We Need, When We Need It

Instead of designing a comprehensive component system upfront, we'll build components incrementally based on actual implementation needs and current pain points.

## ⚠️ SCOPE: HTML + JavaScript ONLY (No CSS)

---

## IMMEDIATE NEEDS ASSESSMENT

Let's start by identifying what's actually needed right now based on your current pages and content:

### Current Pages That Need Components:
1. **Blog/Insights listing** (`/blog/index.vue` - needs improvement)
2. **Case studies listing** (`/case-studies/index.vue` - needs improvement)  
3. **Individual blog posts** (`/blog/[...slug].vue` - basic but functional)
4. **Individual case studies** (`/case-studies/[...slug].vue` - basic but functional)
5. **Homepage** (`/index.vue` - needs content presentation)

### Content We Have:
- **5 blog posts** with rich metadata (15+ fields)
- **6 case studies** with client/project structure  
- **Static pages** (about, contact, what-we-do)

---

## START HERE: Essential Atoms & Molecules

Build only what we need for the immediate pages above:

### Foundation Atoms (Build First)
1. **`ccmButton`** - Generic button (needed for CTAs everywhere)
2. **`ccmBadge`** - For tags, categories, client names, etc.
3. **`ccmTimestamp`** - For consistent date formatting
4. **`ccmHeading`** - For semantic heading hierarchy

### Essential Molecules (Build Next)
1. **`ccmCard`** - Generic content card for blog/case study listings
2. **`ccmMetaList`** - For author, date, client, industry metadata
3. **`ccmBadgeList`** - Collection of tags/categories

### First Organism (Build When Ready)
1. **`ccmContentList`** - Generic listing with filtering for blog/case studies

---

## INCREMENTAL BUILD STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Fix Current Pain Points
**Goal:** Improve existing pages with minimal new components

**Tasks:**
1. Create basic `ccmCard` to replace static content cards
2. Create `ccmBadgeList` for consistent tag display
3. Create `ccmMetaList` for consistent metadata
4. Update `/blog/index.vue` to use new components
5. Update `/case-studies/index.vue` to use new components

**Success Criteria:** Blog and case study indexes look consistent and professional

### Phase 2: Enhance Single Content Pages
**Goal:** Improve individual blog post and case study pages

**Tasks:**
1. Create `ccmButton` for consistent CTAs
2. Enhance existing `ccmPostHero` if needed
3. Add related content suggestions
4. Add proper metadata display

**Success Criteria:** Individual content pages have proper CTAs and related content

### Phase 3: Build As We Go
**Approach:** Add new components only when we encounter specific problems or needs

**Examples:**
- Need filtering? Build `ccmSearchBox` 
- Need better navigation? Build `ccmBreadcrumb`
- Need contact forms? Build `ccmFormField`
- Need client portfolios? Build components then

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Building Any Component:
1. **Identify the specific problem** (e.g., "case study cards look inconsistent")
2. **Check if existing component can be extended** (e.g., can `ccmCard` handle it?)
3. **Start with simplest solution** (e.g., basic HTML + props)
4. **Test with actual content** (e.g., use real blog posts/case studies)
5. **Refine based on usage** (e.g., add features as needs arise)

### Component Development Order:
1. **HTML structure** - Semantic, accessible markup
2. **Props interface** - What data does it need?  
3. **Slot architecture** - What parts are customizable?
4. **Basic functionality** - Core behavior only
5. **Test with real content** - Use actual blog posts, case studies
6. **Iterate based on usage** - Add features as needed

### Example - Building ccmCard Incrementally:

**Version 1: Basic Card**
```vue
<template>
  <article>
    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ excerpt }}</p>
  </article>
</template>
```

**Version 2: Add Metadata** (when we need it)
```vue
<template>
  <article>
    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    <div v-if="metadata">
      <span v-for="item in metadata">{{ item }}</span>
    </div>
    <p>{{ excerpt }}</p>
  </article>
</template>
```

**Version 3: Add Actions** (when we need them)
```vue
<template>
  <article>
    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    <div v-if="metadata">...</div>
    <p>{{ excerpt }}</p>
    <div v-if="actions">
      <button v-for="action in actions">{{ action.text }}</button>
    </div>
  </article>
</template>
```

## DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK

### When to Build a New Component:
✅ **Yes, build it** if:
- Same HTML structure needed in 2+ places
- Specific functionality needed multiple times  
- Current approach is causing maintenance issues

❌ **No, don't build it** if:
- Only used in one place
- Simple HTML can solve it
- Overengineering a simple problem

### When to Extend vs Create New:
- **Extend existing** if 80% of functionality overlaps
- **Create new** if fundamentally different purpose
- **Refactor both** if discovering common patterns

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

Instead of measuring "components built," measure:

1. **Problem solved** - Did it fix the immediate issue?
2. **Reusability achieved** - Is it being used in multiple places?
3. **Maintenance reduced** - Is it easier to update content?
4. **Development speed** - Are new similar features faster to build?

## CURRENT IMMEDIATE NEEDS

Based on your repository, let's start with:

### Week 1: Blog Index Improvement
- Build `ccmCard` for blog posts
- Build `ccmBadgeList` for tags
- Update `/blog/index.vue`

### Week 2: Case Study Index Improvement  
- Extend `ccmCard` for case studies (or build `ccmCaseCard` if too different)
- Build `ccmMetaList` for client/industry data
- Update `/case-studies/index.vue`

### Week 3: Individual Page Enhancement
- Build `ccmButton` for CTAs
- Add related content to single pages
- Improve metadata display

### Week 4+: Build Based on Discovered Needs
- Whatever problems emerge from using the first components

This approach ensures we're solving real problems rather than building theoretical solutions!
