## Key Strategic Insights

**CCM's Business Model:** Strategic design consultancy specializing in translating complex ideas into clear, effective digital experiences for mission-driven organizations (research institutions, non-profits, think tanks, academic centers, policy groups).

**PX Methodology Core:** Unlike UX (help users do what they want), PX makes it easy for prospects to do what YOU want them to do. Every page has a single primary action guiding prospects through: Researcher → Evaluator → Buyer stages.

**Client-Project Relationship:** Each case study represents a project with one or more clients. Need comprehensive portfolio presentation showing work by client, by project type, and cross-referenced relationships.

## Component Development Implications

1. **PX-Driven Architecture:** All components must support CCM's prospect experience methodology
2. **Primary Action Focus:** Every component should guide toward single, clear primary actions
3. **Progressive Engagement:** Components must support the buyer journey progression
4. **Professional Authority:** Maintain CCM's "Confident, Clear-Sighted Guide" positioning
5. **Content Quality Standards:** Support "Novel, Specific, Profound" content presentation
6. **Client Portfolio Showcase:** Enable comprehensive project-client relationship display
