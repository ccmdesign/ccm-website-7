# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis (project loaded in Claude Code)

**Current Project State**: This is a Nuxt 3 website project with client-side rendering (SSR disabled) that uses Vue 3 composition API. The project follows a component-based architecture with custom CSS using CSS layers and is CMS agnostic. It includes Nuxt Content for file-based content management.

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Using existing project analysis from CLAUDE.md:**

Available Documentation:
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Nuxt 3, Vue 3, TypeScript, PostCSS)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (component-based with ccm prefix naming)
- ✅ Coding Standards (Vue 3 Composition API, CSS layers methodology)
- ✅ API Documentation (Nuxt Content integration)
- ❌ External API Documentation 
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (beyond CSS layer structure)
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Description**: 
Build a content skeleton system with data piping components that transforms raw Nuxt Content into properly structured static HTML pages. Create bare-bones components with minimal HTML tags and the logic necessary to pull content from Nuxt Content and pipe it between components for static site generation. Focus exclusively on making content flow work without any visual styling.

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ New Feature Addition (content skeleton and data piping system)

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) - This will add content piping components and composables while preserving existing patterns.

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Create content skeleton that pipes data from Nuxt Content to static HTML pages
• Build data piping components with bare-bones HTML and content flow logic
• Implement composables for content fetching, filtering, and relationship mapping at build time
• Generate static pages for all content types (blog posts, case studies, client profiles)
• Enable content relationships and cross-references in static site generation

**Background Context**: 
CCM website has foundational Nuxt Content integration but needs a content skeleton system to properly pipe rich content data to static HTML pages. Current system has basic components but lacks the data piping logic needed to transform Nuxt Content into structured static pages for blog posts (15+ metadata fields), case studies, and client portfolios. The skeleton must work as static generation before visual design is applied.
