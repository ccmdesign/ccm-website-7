# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Vue 3 SFC, Markdown (content files)
**Frameworks**: Nuxt 3 with **Static Site Generation** (`nuxt generate`), Vue 3 Composition API
**Content Management**: Nuxt Content with file-based CMS (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)
**Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS, TypeScript compiler
**Static Generation**: Nuxt's built-in SSG capabilities for complete pre-rendering
**Deployment**: Static file output compatible with Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any CDN

## Integration Approach

**Static Generation Strategy**: All content processing happens at build time using `nuxt generate` command
- Content queries execute during build to create static HTML for all pages
- Related content relationships pre-calculated and embedded in static markup
- All filtering/pagination options become separate static routes
- No runtime API calls or client-side content fetching

**Component Integration Strategy**: Components designed for SSG with progressive enhancement
- Server-rendered HTML structure with semantic markup
- Client-side JavaScript adds interactivity on top of functional static content
- All PX methodology logic baked into static HTML structure
- Progressive enhancement for non-essential interactive features

**Content Processing Strategy**: Build-time optimization for all content relationships
- Nuxt Content processes all Markdown files during `nuxt generate`
- Frontmatter relationships mapped to static route generation
- Client-project associations pre-computed into static HTML
- Search/filtering implemented as static route generation rather than dynamic queries

## Code Organization and Standards

**Static Generation File Structure**: 
- `/content/` - Markdown files processed at build time
- `/components/` - SSG-compatible Vue components with ccm prefix
- `/composables/` - Build-time utilities for content processing
- `/pages/` - Route definitions that generate static HTML files
- `nuxt.config.ts` - SSG configuration with `nitro: { prerender: { routes: [...] } }`

**Build-Time Component Standards**:
- Components must work with Nuxt's server-side rendering during generation
- All data dependencies resolved at build time through composables
- No runtime content API calls or dynamic imports
- Progressive enhancement pattern for any client-side interactivity

## Deployment and Operations

**Static Build Process**: 
- `nuxt generate` produces complete static site in `dist/` directory
- All content relationships pre-computed during build
- Generated site contains no server dependencies
- Build process handles incremental updates when content changes

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- Deploy static files to CDN/static hosting service
- No server-side runtime required
- Perfect caching since all content is static
- Build process triggered by content changes in repository

**Performance Monitoring**: 
- Lighthouse scores for static site performance
- Build time monitoring for content processing efficiency
- Static asset optimization during generation process

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Build Complexity Risks**: 
- Complex content relationships may increase build time significantly
- Solution: Optimize content queries and implement incremental builds

**Static Generation Limitations**: 
- No dynamic content filtering without JavaScript
- Solution: Pre-generate all filter combinations as static routes

**Content Update Workflow**: 
- Content changes require full site rebuild and redeployment
- Solution: Implement automated build/deploy pipeline triggered by content commits

**SEO and Performance Benefits**: 
- Perfect SEO since all content is pre-rendered HTML
- Excellent performance scores with static delivery
- No runtime content loading delays
