# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system will create **data piping components** with bare-bones HTML structure and logic to pull content from Nuxt Content and pass it between components during static site generation

**FR2**: Content fetching composables will leverage **Nuxt's `generate` command** to pre-process all content queries, relationships, and transformations at build time, creating static HTML for all content types

**FR3**: **Content skeleton components** will handle blog posts, case studies, and client profiles with minimal HTML tags and the specific logic needed to pipe content data through the static generation process

**FR4**: **Build-time composables** (useContentPipeline, useContentRelationships, useStaticRoutes) will process content during generation and provide data structures to piping components

**FR5**: **Content relationship mapping** will pre-compute connections between posts, case studies, clients, and projects during build time and embed them in static HTML structure

**FR6**: **Static page generation** will create all content index pages, detail pages, and cross-reference pages using the content piping components without runtime content queries

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: All data piping components must be **SSG-compatible** with bare-bones HTML output and no runtime content queries - all processing happens during `nuxt generate` command

**NFR2**: Content skeleton must generate **clean, semantic HTML** structure that works without JavaScript and provides foundation for future CSS implementation

**NFR3**: Build process must handle complete content piping and generate all static pages with embedded content relationships

**NFR4**: Components must use minimal HTML tags with only the logic necessary to pipe content data between components during static generation

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Must integrate with **Nuxt's `nuxt generate`** command to produce fully static website deployable to any static hosting service

**CR2**: All content piping must use **Nuxt Content's static generation capabilities** rather than runtime API calls

**CR3**: Data piping components must work with existing ccm component naming conventions and preserve current CSS class structures

**CR4**: Content skeleton must support **future CSS implementation** without breaking the HTML structure or data piping logic
