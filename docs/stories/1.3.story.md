# Story 1.3: Content Relationship Components

**Status:** Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** content author,  
**I want** components that pipe related content connections,  
**so that** content relationships appear in static HTML without runtime queries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create `ccmRelatedPosts`, `ccmClientPortfolio`, `ccmProjectLinks` relationship components
2. Components use data from `useContentRelationships` composable to render HTML lists
3. Handle blog-to-case-study, client-to-project, and post-to-tag relationships
4. Generate static HTML with all relationships pre-computed

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create `ccmRelatedPosts` component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Accept content item and relationships data from useContentRelationships composable
  - [x] Render semantic list of related blog posts with titles and links
  - [x] Filter relationships by type and strength scoring
  - [x] Follow existing ccm component patterns and CSS class structures
- [x] Create `ccmClientPortfolio` component (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Display case studies grouped by client organization
  - [x] Use relationship data to connect client names to project slugs
  - [x] Render portfolio grid with client branding and project previews
  - [x] Integrate with existing ccmMasterGrid layout system
- [x] Create `ccmProjectLinks` component (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Show cross-references between blog posts and case studies
  - [x] Use tag similarity and category matching from relationship algorithms
  - [x] Render bidirectional links with computed relationship reasons
  - [x] Support both inline and sidebar placement patterns
- [x] Implement static HTML generation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Ensure all relationship data is pre-computed during build time
  - [x] Test components work correctly during `nuxt generate` process
  - [x] Verify no runtime API calls are made for relationship data
  - [x] Validate all relationship links work in static deployment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
- **Story 1.1 Complete**: `useContentPipeline`, `useContentRelationships`, `useStaticRoutes` composables available in `composables/` directory
- **Story 1.2 Complete**: `ccmContentMeta`, `ccmContentList`, `ccmContentDetail` components available in `components/` directory with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Architecture References
**Source**: `docs/architecture/components.md#Frontend Component Hierarchy`

**Component Integration Pattern**:
- **Level 2 Content Components**: New relationship components will be Level 2 components in the architecture
- **Dependency Flow**: Relationship Components → Content Components (Level 1) → Foundation Components (Level 0)
- **Layout Integration**: Use existing `ccmMasterGrid` (Level 0) for portfolio grids and `ccmBaseSection` (Level 0) for content sections

**Source**: `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`

**File Structure**:
```
components/                 # Component Library
├── ccmRelatedPosts.vue    # Related content links component (NEW)
├── ccmClientPortfolio.vue # Client project portfolio component (NEW)
└── ccmProjectLinks.vue    # Cross-reference links component (NEW)
```

### Existing Component Patterns Analysis
**Source**: Current `components/ccmContentMeta.vue`, `components/ccmContentList.vue`, `components/ccmContentDetail.vue`

**Established Patterns**:
- Uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript interfaces
- Accepts content data through props from build-time composables
- Renders semantic HTML structure with existing ccm CSS classes
- NuxtLink components for content navigation

**Integration Strategy**:
- **Follow existing component patterns**: Use same prop structure and TypeScript interfaces
- **Extend with relationship data**: Accept relationship arrays from useContentRelationships composable
- **Maintain CSS class patterns**: Use existing ccm component CSS class naming conventions

### Component API Integration 
**Source**: `types/content.ts`, `composables/useContentRelationships.ts`

**ccmRelatedPosts Props**:
```typescript
interface RelatedPostsProps {
  currentItem: BlogPost | CaseStudy     // Current content item
  relationships: ContentRelationship[]  // From useContentRelationships
  limit?: number                        // Max number of related items
  variant?: 'sidebar' | 'footer' | 'inline'
  class?: string
}
```

**ccmClientPortfolio Props**:
```typescript  
interface ClientPortfolioProps {
  clientName: string                    // Client organization name
  projects: CaseStudy[]                 // Related case studies
  relationships: ContentRelationship[]  // From useContentRelationships
  variant?: 'grid' | 'list' | 'carousel'
  showImages?: boolean
  class?: string
}
```

**ccmProjectLinks Props**:
```typescript
interface ProjectLinksProps {
  sourceContent: BlogPost | CaseStudy   // Current content item
  crossReferences: ContentRelationship[] // Bidirectional relationships
  variant?: 'tags' | 'categories' | 'related'
  showReasons?: boolean                 // Show computed relationship reasons
  class?: string
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**Source**: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`

- **Nuxt 3 Static Generation**: Pages must work with `nuxt generate` process
- **CSS Layer Architecture**: Follow existing CSS layer system (reset→defaults→utils→overrides)
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Use `<script setup>` pattern for consistency
- **TypeScript Integration**: Import and use existing TypeScript interfaces from `types/components.ts`

### Layout System Integration
**Source**: `docs/architecture/components.md#ccmLayoutSystem`

**ccmMasterGrid Integration**:
- **Responsibility**: "Enhanced grid system supporting dynamic content layouts"  
- **Usage Pattern**: Wrap page content in ccmMasterGrid component
- **Dependencies**: CSS layer system, responsive grid system
- **Integration Points**: Works with existing ccmTopbar and ccmFooter components

## Testing

### Test File Locations
**Source**: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization`

- `tests/components/` - Component integration tests
- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end page functionality tests  
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test content data

### Testing Requirements

**Component Integration Tests**:
```typescript  
// tests/components/relationshipComponents.test.ts
// Test ccmRelatedPosts integration with relationship data
// Test ccmClientPortfolio grid rendering with case studies
// Test ccmProjectLinks bidirectional relationship display
```

**E2E Relationship Tests**:
```typescript
// tests/e2e/content-relationships.spec.ts  
// Test related post links work correctly in static site
// Test client portfolio navigation between projects
// Test cross-reference links maintain context properly
```

**Static Generation Tests**:
```typescript
// tests/build-process/relationship-generation.test.ts
// Verify all relationship components generate correctly during build
// Test build performance impact of relationship computation
// Validate relationship HTML structure in static output
```

### Test Data Requirements
**Source**: `tests/fixtures/sample-blog-posts.json`, `tests/fixtures/sample-case-studies.json`

- Use existing test fixtures for consistent relationship testing
- Mock useContentRelationships composable data in component tests
- Test with relationship data connecting BlogPost and CaseStudy content types
- Include mock relationship strength scoring and computed reasons

### Testing Framework and Patterns
**Source**: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + Vue Test Utils for component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component + content data integration testing  
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user journey testing
- **Test Pattern**: Mount relationship components with mock relationship data, verify DOM output and link interactions
