# Content Strategy Framework

## PX (Prospect Experience) Methodology
**Core Philosophy:** Guide specific users (prospects) through specific actions YOU define, not what they want to do.

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Address Specific Users:** Design for ideal prospects, not general audience
2. **Encourage Specific Interactions:** Every piece has clear primary action
3. **Expect Specific Outcomes:** Create purposeful, predictable flow through buying cycle

## Content Quality Standards: "Novel, Specific, Profound"
To break through noise, content ideas must be:
- **Novel:** Fresh perspective, not rehashed common wisdom
- **Specific:** Detailed, actionable, with concrete examples
- **Profound:** Strong unique point of view that challenges thinking

## Content Structure Pattern
**Problem → Solution → Results**
- Focus on outcomes and impact, not process details
- Lead with mission/challenge context
- Support with methodology only as needed
- Always connect back to social impact/advancing knowledge

## Reference & Credibility Standards
- All sources must be tracked and preserved
- Maintain reference chain: research → outline → draft
- Use credible sources with proper attribution
- Include footnotes/citations for authority
- Prepare content for both human readers AND AI consumption

## SEO Approach
- Write for humans first, not Google
- Focus on user intent over keyword stuffing
- Create content that genuinely serves the audience's information needs
