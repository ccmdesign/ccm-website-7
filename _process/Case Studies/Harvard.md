## Harvard

Spotlight Award Publication and website
The Tech Spotlight Award recognizes products and initiatives that apply technology to serve the overall public good. Harvard approached CCM to help them with the award's product strategy and branding.
The logo features stage lights flashing from three spotlights, forming a crown that symbolizes the award. Since Harvard and the Belfer Center already have a powerful and recognizable logo, the award logo must be remarkable without rivaling the institutions.
Initially, there would be an award ceremony with the presence of all the participants, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole event moved online. With this change, the briefing shifted from an initial branding and event material to Product Design and User Experience, tackling the challenge of presenting the participants in a website and a publication.
The website follows the color scheme and visual identity from Harvard but has its own character, displaying the award information in a unique and intuitive way. Thus, the running-ups and the public can immediately recognize the link between the award and the University and are able to easily access all the information about the event and its participants.
The award highlighted projects from IBM, Google, the NYT, among others.

Harvard approached us to help them with the product strategy and branding for the Tech Spotlight Award.

Originally there would be a ceremony with all the participants, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event had to be remodelled into an online ceremony. With that, our contribution shifted from an initial branding and event material to Product Design and User Experience, tackling the challenge of presenting the whole event in a website and a publication.

The Tech Spotlight Award awards projects and initiatives that apply technology to serve the overall public good. The award already highlighted projects from IBM, Google, the NYT, among others.
