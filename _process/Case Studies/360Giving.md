We help non-profits optimize their branding and digital product development

**Description**
In 2019 and 2020 we worked with 360Giving to overhaul their branding and interfaces. They had multiple products in multiple in multiple platforms, each with its own interface and frontend codebase.

We created a design system for them, where their team can easily pull standardized components to be used in any of their products.

The system improved their work in a four fronts:

Efficiency, by providing easy and quick code snippets to be re-used across the products.

Autonomy, by the re-use of components, their internal team can assemble interfaces with little input from designers.

UX Quality, by re-using components across products, we create a consistent user experience, lowering the cognitive friction when interacting with any interface of their suite.

Technical Quality. By leveraging the components each product is always using highly semantic and accessible markup and very robust and responsive css, to make sure the components work in the ever increasing variety of devices. This results in better accessibility for visually impaired people and better search engine results.

We created a design system for them, where their team can easily pull standardized components to be used in any of their products.

The system brought improved their work in three different levels:

- Efficiency, providing easy and quick code snippets to be re-used across the products.
- Autonomy, by the re-use of components, their internal team can assemble interfaces with little input from designers
- UX Quality, by re-using components across products, we create a consistent user experience, lowering the cognitive friction when interacting with any interface of their suite.

## Ideas

Efetivamente criamos um novo branding para a 360. 

A estrategia foi criar um design system, para que a equipe interna deles pudesse criar novos produtos a partir desse sistema de interface. 

Com o sistema. criamos 6 produtos, em diferentes tecnologias, mantendo as interfaces consistentes e o processo de criação de frontend bem mais "streamlined" e eficiente.

Depois que entregamos o Design System, eles já criaram 1 ou 2 produtos internamente.
