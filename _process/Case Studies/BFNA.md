## Ideas

**How to Fix Democracy** - o conceito central foi fazer o "netflix para democracy"

**Future of Work** - criarmos uma plataforma para mostrar uma serie de "case studies" sobre como AI, robotics e automation vão impactar o mercado de trabalho. Para os case studies escolheram cidades especificas, que seriam particularmente vulneraveis a especificas inovacoes.

**People -led Innovation** - Uma parceria entre o Govlab e a BFNA, essa publicação explora as possibilidades das inovações no setor publico, utilizando um "user-centric approach". Esse projeto foi indicado para o Paris Peace Forum de 2018*[conferir no site].*

**BFNA Website -** O primeiro projeto que estamos fazendo com a intenção de criarmos um novo branding para a BFNA.

## People-led Innovation

This project started as a publication created from a partnership between The GovLab and The Bertelsmann Foundation(BFNA) and designed by CCM.

The publication itself got a lot of attention and in 2018 it was selected for the Paris Peace Forum. For this award, working together with The GovLab and BFNA to transport the publication to the web, CCM created alternative views for the main sections, and an easier way for users to interact with the content.

As it happens with online publications, when working on a text-heavy environment, it is very important to be accurate in the information architecture and typography, and also keep it attractive with a clever use of colours.

## How to Fix Democracy

Briefed as "the Netflix of Democracy" this project gathers interviews with high profile democracy experts from around the planet, trying to tackle the big question of "How to Fix Democracy".

For this project, the design team main objective was to highlight each video interviewee as the star of that single episode. The interface concept revolved around the idea of a tv show that builds up around a central theme.

Leveraging the general knowledge of how to browse a streaming service, CCM designed an interface that is most of all intuitive.

Hosted by Andrew Keen, this project is a huge success and is now on its second season. The episodes are available in video and podcast.

## Future of Work

The BFNA's project the "Future of Work | Transatlantic Cities" develops case studies analyzing how technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Robotics, etc. will impact cities across the US and Europe.

This project has a very interesting research approach and the information presented demanded a design that "illustrates" how the future of each city will be impacted differently by each of these technologies - one city will see a deep impact from Robotics, while another won't suffer much, but instead will be striken by AI usage.

Being case studies, there is a lot to unpack for each city, with long form texts. Information Architecture was really key here, in order to have these case studies easily scannable by the readers.

CCM team decided to present these case studies with a fair amount of visual information, and an easy to read interface with lots of white space, giving readers a comfortable environment to sit back and read through the content.

## BFNA Website

Bertelsmann Foundation appointed CCM to help them with their digital branding.

The BFNA is a think tank that produces multiple digital products. It is extremely important that their website has a simple and intuitive structure. That was CCM's main contribution to the new BFNA website - a well built "information architecture", where all the projects are accessible in an easy and clean way.

From a simpler category structure for the organization itself, CCM team was able to create in collaboration with BFNA, very clear groups of products, articles, publications, etc. Now, instead of dozens of categories and post-types, there are four 'buckets' to accommodate every new product they create.

The colours and graphic elements should be neutral, but at the same time modern and noticeable, in order to create a 'home' that accommodates the different projects from the institution. Key elements like the buttons and the bars follow the same aesthetic CCM team designed for independent projects from BFNA and also presented in its website, creating a bond based in the institution visual identity.

## Federalism in Crisis publication

Federalism in Crisis is part of the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Newpolitik project, devoted to exploring the most pressing challenges facing the United States and Germany. This publication covers how these two federations have had very different pandemic experiences.

The challenge was to create a design that showed two different faces of the same problem: Two federations facing the Covid-19 challenge. The visual concept should guide the reader through the report, keeping the central theme as the key point and illustrating historical and particular aspects of each nation.

The red/blue/white transitioned to the black/red/yellow, keeping the same design reference but allowing different perceptions as the reading develops.

Bertelsmann Foundation appointed us to help them with their **digital branding**.

The BFNA is a think tank that produces multiple **digital products**.

One of our main contributions was collaborating with them to simplify the institution's "information architecture" and consequently, simplify the website's IA. By creating a simpler category structure for the organization itself, we were able to create very clear groups of products, articles, publications, etc. Now, instead of dozens of categories and post-types, we have four buckets, and every single thing they create, needs to fall in one of these buckets.

It is very satisfying to work with a team that is 100% open to adopt constraints on their own work so the **user experience** is more clear.

A client that understands that user experience starts by organizing a content you didn't even wrote yet.

## Future of Work

One of the projects we work with the BFNA is the "Future of Work | Transatlantic Cities". This project creates case studies analyzing the impact of technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence**, Automation, **Robotics**, etc. will have on several cities across the US and Europe.

This is a very interesting project, not only because it covers these bleeding edge technologies but also on the research approach. How each city will be impacted differently by each of these technologies.

One city will see a deep impact from Robotics, while another won't suffer much, and instead will suffer from AI usage.

Given the subject we are working with and the content structure, we decided to create online case studies, with a fair amount of visual information.

Inevitably, we would need to deal with long form text, these are case studies after all, and there is a lot to unpack in each city, so we designed an easy to read interface, with lots of white space giving readers a comfortable environment to sit back and read the content.

Information Architecture was really key here, in order to have these case studies easily scannable by the readers.

## How to Fix Democracy

Another great project we work with the BFNA team is the How to Fix Democracy website. Briefed as "the Netflix of Democracy" this project gathers interviews with high profile **democracy experts** around the planet, trying to tackle the big question of "How to Fix Democracy".

For this project, base don the brief, our main objective was to highlight the video and the interviewee as much as possible. The interface concept revolved around the idea of this single show "Netflix". We designed this interface leveraging what we are already used to when browsing through different shows on streaming services.

Hosted by **Andrew Keen**, this project was a huge success and is now on its second season. The episodes are available in video and podcast.

As it happens with online publications, it is necessary to work on a text-heavy environment, so as it happens often with our projects, we need to be very careful with information architecture and typography, and be very generous with white space.
