We help non-profits by creating impactful branding systems

**Description**
In 2020, we worked with the Global Data Barometer to design a branding system that translated their core values and objectives.

The Global Data Barometer maps the landscape of data for public good. This mapping works in four different dimensions, which would be measured as a radar chart with 4 dimensions.

Based on this idea, we designed a logo system that has incorporates these dimensions in the logo itself.
