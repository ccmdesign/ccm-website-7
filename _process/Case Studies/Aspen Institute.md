Annual Report

branding do material do curso

## Objetivo

Talvez enquadrar o projeto como branding de um curso de "inovação em policy" pode ser uma boa ideia.

## Tagline

> We help to present bright ideas for the public sector challenges translating them into compelling white papers.

We translate bright ideas for the public sector challenges into compelling white papers.

## Ideas

Esse projeto em si eu acho meio bobo e de pouco valor para o nosso portfolio.

Acho que se conseguirmos comunicar que a ideia de trabalhar como "design support" para o curso da Betsy é importante por entrarmos em contato com os inovadores que estão no curso, e que os temas abordados são super dentro do nosso nicho, etc. pode ser uma boa "desculpa" para termos aceitado esse projeto meio low-level.

## Aspen

The Aspen Institute designed the Tech Executive Leadership Initiative course to be an incubator for innovative projects in the technology and public policy field.

They approached CCM for support with the design of their publications. The main objective was to reinforce a strong brand by creating multiple policy documents with a streamlined and cost-effective process since we were dealing with dozens of manuscripts within a short timeframe.

The proximity between these startup projects and CCM's work with its clients made this project an instant match. It is refreshing and rewarding to collaborate with new ideas and initiatives that focus on solutions for the public sector challenges.
