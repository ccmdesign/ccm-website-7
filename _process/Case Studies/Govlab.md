# Conteúdo

The GovLab is a think tank with high popular founders and an ambitious mission. The challenge was quite hard.

We were expecting text heavy material with a dry subject. Our mission was to showcase these as contemporary, future-oriented products that were bringing a new way of thinking about public problems. A typography-based design, an intense color palette and a grid oriented layout were our most precious allies.

Over these 5 years, we were able to create several remarkable products for Govlab, from a [TEDx presentation](https://www.ted.com/talks/stefaan_verhulst_using_corporate_data_to_improve_our_lives) to an [online report at the Paris Peace Forum](https://peopleledinnovation.org/#/).

Among these products, we always had an unifying thread, unraveling, day by day, resulting in a consistent experience when interacting with their products.

## Design System

Over these years we created about a dozen websites, trained an in-house development team, and to guarantee the visual quality of the projects to come, we documented the components we created for them in a pattern library, so they could be leveraged by their in-house team, maintaining the visual quality of the interface, the high quality of our frontend code and saving them countless hours of development time.

## Open Data Policy Lab

For this initiative, in partnership with Microsoft, we created the branding and the website, in such a way that we could leverage the high levels of accessibility and SEO implemented in the Design System, but maintaining the unique look-and-feel the project required.

## Big Data for Migration

This initiative, we designed the logo and the website, also leveraging the design system, which made it possible to build things more efficiently without compromising the accessibility and SEO built-into the DS, and maintaining the unique branding characteristics of the project.

## Open Data Impact

One of the big projects we built in partnership with GovLab's internal team. This was a larger project, with multiple case studies weaved together in a highly visual website.

## Smarter Crowdsourcing

A whole branding system, with several products underneath it, like a website, infographics, reports, social media campaign images, and more. This project consists of multiple online discussion around public service related topics.

## Objetivo

Queremos mostrar que trabalhamos com esse cliente há muitos anos, e que essa longa parceria nos possibilitou de criar um branding que engloba vários dos produtos, marcas, e diferentes midias (Sites, e Relatorios).

## Tagline

> We help research institutions present their content in an engaging
> 

## Ideas

- Since 2013, we've been working with the GovLab @ NYU, helping them to build digital products.
- we redesigned their website, and built many digital produtcs for them.
- this long-term partnership allowed us to create a design system, used by most of their products.
- this created an unified visual communication strategy, making these products easily recognizable as part of an institution-wide product-family.
- Um termo legal de usar seria ***"a design system spanning across multiple products and medias"***
- fico pensando se não deveríamos usar a logo da NYU como cliente, ao invés do Govlab só.

## Design System

- little reliance on images yet an engaging visual
- typographic approach
- bold use of colors

# Paper Info

**Intro**

In 2013, Beth Noveck approached us to help her with the overall branding of her think tank “The Govlab”. The challenge was quite hard. The subject was dry, to say the least. The stakes were high, since Beth is one of the superstars in the field. Looking backwards, is much easier to understand the full scope of this 5 year+ partnership.

**Scope**

A think tank with high popularity founders and an ambitious mission.

Format-wise, the main products that would be coming out of this team were High Profile Talks, Reports, Websites, Webapps, etc. Content-wise, the outputs were much wider and deeper, but design-wise, these were the usual suspects.

We were expecting text heavy material, with a dry subject. Titles like “Criminal Law Policy Assessment” are the normal. Our mission was to showcase these as contemporary, future-oriented products, that were bringing a new way of thinking about public problems.

**Our Solution**

Typography based design

Color palettes and layout were our most precious allies.

Over these 5 years, we were able to create several remarkable products for Govlab, from a [TEDx presentation](https://www.ted.com/talks/stefaan_verhulst_using_corporate_data_to_improve_our_lives) to an [online report at the Paris Peace Forum](https://peopleledinnovation.org/#/).

Among these products, some high profile other much more mundane, there has always been a unifying thread, unraveling, day by day, which would result in a consistent experience when interacting with one of their products. In this case study we showcase a few projects that illustrate well the outcomes of this partnership.

**High Profile Presentations**

TEDx, OGP, TicTec, PDF. You name it and we were there. One of the main activities done by the Govlab founders is public speaking, and creating engaging presentations that actually support the speaker is a big part of the work we do for them and others.

**Publications**

Think tanks are always producing valuable insights and our job is to innovate on how to format, package and publish these knowledge products. The People-led innovation Report is a very good example of that. Initially created as an offline, printed publication, the report was so well received by the audience that it got selected for the Paris Peace Forum. That further fueled us to invest more time and creativity to showcase the information in an online format that allowed users to easily interact with the content and consume it bits by bits without the full weight of a PDF.

**Smarter Crowdsourcing**

A whole sub-brand, with several products underneath it, like a website, infographics, reports, social media campaign images, and more.

**Network of Innovators**

A full blown web app to connect public servants all around the world. We were involved in the whole process for this product, from conceptualization and branding, through UX and UI design all the way to leading the development team on launching the Beta.

**Styleguide and Design System**

Over these years we created about a dozen websites, trained an in-house development team, and to guarantee the visual quality of the projects to come, we documented all the components we created for them in a pattern library, so they could be leveraged by the in-house team, maintaining the visual quality of the interface, the high quality of our frontend code and saving them countless hours of development time.
