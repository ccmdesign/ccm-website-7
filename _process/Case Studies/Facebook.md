Facebook Policy Initiatives

# Background

Facebook Canada Team is working hard in the social change field on many fronts, from helping their millions of users be better informed and safer in the platform, to understand how the most remote and isolated people in the North Pole are using facebook.com and the internet to improve their lives.

Each of the multiple small projects has its own audiences and specific objectives to be sustained by a good design strategy.

## Election Integrity Project

The main objetive of this project was to explain Facebook’s security features to politicians and their teams in Canada. To accomplish that we took under consideration the nature of the audience and the limited timeframe to execute the project, we created an instructions-manual-like tutorial, sent by Facebook Canada to the various politicians and public figures in Canada.

Once the project got bigger and more widely accepted, we created a small website, publicly available, to host the files online.

This project was a big success and, so far, we’ve designed this manual for Canada, India, Mexico, Latin America and Sweden.

## Hard Questions Roundtables

Facebook Canada “Hard Questions” brings to light and actively faces some of he “HardQuestions” that permeate our society. The initiative itself consists of a series of roundtables to discuss these topics. Our role was to create a way for people to see live events streamed on [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com) and access the recordings.

Striving for simplicity, we came up with a very simple user flow and information architecture, following the client’s branding guidelines.

## Connectivity Boost

**The Problem -** Facebook Policy Canada is working on a series of events documenting how people from remote communities in Canada are using the internet and Facebook.

These stories are very important to understand how a connection to the internet can change people’s lives in many different ways.

**Design Process -** By understanding the core need from Facebook’s Policy team and on what level they expected the different user personas to interact with the website, we set three main functionalities for the site: To present the next events; receive suggestions for potential upcoming events; and showcase the stories.

As for user flows and needs, we traced two: For the person from the remote community who wants to add their community to the list of potential places, we designed a simple and easy form to be filled in online

For the users that want to learn about the stories, we decided to go for long scrolls and a nicely laid out story to captivate these users and really show the essence of the people we are talking about through a good storytelling perspective of the event.

# Outcome

At the moment, we have multiple websites online, showcasing the amazing work the policy teams at Facebook are doing all over the world, and informing people on a wide range of necessary subjects.

This is an ongoing project, expect to see more projects added to the list above. We are very excited to work with the Facebook Policy teams all over the world and, so far, the feedback we received from the team and the users couldn’t be better.
