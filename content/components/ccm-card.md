The `ccm-card` component is a flexible linking component that adapts its layout based on screen size. It's built on top of `nuxt-link` for optimal routing performance and supports both image and text-only configurations.

## Responsive Behavior

The card automatically adapts its layout for different screen sizes:

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Stacked layout with image on top, text below
- **Desktop (â‰¥ 768px)**: Side-by-side layout with alternating image positions

### Desktop Layout Pattern

On desktop screens, cards automatically alternate their layout:
- **Odd cards**: Image left, text right
- **Even cards**: Image right, text left (with right-aligned text)

## Image Handling

When no image is provided, the component displays a colored background area maintaining the same aspect ratios:
- **Mobile**: 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Desktop**: 1:1 aspect ratio

## Accessibility Features

- Uses semantic `nuxt-link` for proper navigation
- Includes `aria-label` with the provided title
- Maintains proper heading hierarchy within card content
- Keyboard navigation support through native link behavior

## Design System Integration

- **Spacing**: Uses design token system for consistent padding
- **Colors**: Integrates with CSS custom property color tokens
- **Typography**: Inherits text styling from parent contexts
- **Layout**: Responsive grid-friendly sizing
