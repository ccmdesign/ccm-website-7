excerpt: Leading foundations are shifting communications from a support function to core infrastructure. Explore the 4 key traits of high-performing teams.
tldr: |-
  *   **The "Service Bureau" model is obsolete:** Treating communications as a downstream "polishing" function creates bottlenecks and limits impact.
  *   **Infrastructure means autonomy:** High-performing teams manage their own budgets and hold executive seats, moving from order-takers to strategic partners.
  *   **Design belongs at inception:** Leading foundations use Human-Centered Design (HCD) to shape strategies *before* grants are made, preventing costly rework.
  *   **Systems replace heroes:** Sustainable impact relies on robust design systems and governance, not the burnout-prone efforts of individual "unicorns."

  A program officer spends eighteen months developing a complex grantmaking strategy. They conduct landscape analysis, interview experts, and write white papers. Then, two weeks before the launch, the file lands on the desk of the communications director with a simple sticky note: "Please make this look good and get it on the website."

  This scenario, familiar to almost everyone in the sector, represents the "Service Bureau" trap. In this model, communications is a downstream support function—a decoration applied to work that is already finished. While this approach was sufficient for an era of print annual reports and press releases, it is structurally incapable of meeting the demands of a networked digital environment.

  Leading foundations are dismantling this model. They are reclassifying communications from a support service to "core infrastructure." Just as physical infrastructure supports economic activity, communications infrastructure—the systems, data, and brand frameworks—supports programmatic impact. This shift is not merely about better tools; it is about organizational maturity and resilience.

## Shifting from Support Function to Core Infrastructure

The difference between a service bureau and infrastructure is structural. A service bureau reacts to requests; infrastructure enables capacity. When communications operates as infrastructure, it moves from the periphery to the center of the foundation's strategy.

### Budget Autonomy as a Strategic Indicator
You can identify a foundation's maturity by looking at who controls the purse strings. In the service bureau model, communications often has no dedicated budget, forcing leaders to "find money" within program allocations for every initiative. This reinforces a subservient dynamic. Conversely, research indicates that 36% of the most effective nonprofit communications teams draft and manage their own budgets [1].

This financial autonomy allows communications leaders to invest in long-term assets—like digital platforms or audience research—rather than burning resources on ad-hoc requests.

### The Executive Seat
Infrastructure requires governance at the highest level. High-performing foundations increasingly include communications leaders on their executive teams [9]. When communications has a seat at the strategy table, the "voice" of the foundation helps shape the decision-making process, rather than just explaining decisions after they are made.

### Resilience Through Systems
The value of this infrastructure becomes most visible during crises. When the COVID-19 pandemic and social justice movements upended the sector, organizations with robust communications infrastructure were able to pivot messaging and support grantees immediately. Those without it struggled with fragmented responses and disconnected teams [10]. Infrastructure provides the rails that allow the organization to move fast without derailing.

## Design at Inception (The "Co-Creation" Model)

In the construction industry, there is a distinct difference between "Design-Bid-Build" (where architects and builders work in silos) and "Design-Build" (where they collaborate from day one). The traditional foundation model resembles the former: program staff act as architects, and communications staff are treated as mere builders.

This linear handoff creates "technical debt." When design research is skipped during the strategy phase, foundations often build tools or reports that do not fit the actual workflows of their audience. This leads to low adoption and the need for expensive, embarrassing rework post-launch [2].

### Human-Centered Design (HCD) in Practice
Leading organizations prevent this waste by adopting Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodologies at the *inception* of a project.

*   **The Raikes Foundation:** When the Raikes Foundation wanted to improve strategic giving among high-net-worth individuals, they didn't start by building a website. They used HCD to interview donors and prototype solutions. This research revealed that donors didn't need more information; they needed a way to navigate the information that already existed. This insight—gained before a single line of code was written—led to the creation of the "Giving Compass" [3, 14].
*   **The Tower Foundation:** Staff at the Peter & Elizabeth Tower Foundation engaged young people with intellectual disabilities directly in the design of their grantmaking process. By involving the "end user" at the start, they created guidelines that were not just prettier, but fundamentally more accessible and relevant [15].

Moving design upstream changes the output from a "publication" to a solution.

## From "Heroic" Effort to Sustainable Systems

For too long, nonprofit communications has relied on the "unicorn"—a single, overworked individual expected to handle strategy, writing, graphic design, and web development. This "heroic" leadership model is fragile and unsustainable [17].

### The Burnout Epidemic
Reliance on unicorns creates a cycle of burnout. When a team depends on individual heroism rather than established processes, quality fluctuates wildly based on the staff's current energy levels. Creative pitching stops, and the team defaults to "order-taking" just to survive the volume of requests.

### Design Systems as Leverage
The antidote to the unicorn problem is a **Design System**—a collection of reusable components, standards, and guidelines. A design system allows a team to produce high-quality, consistent work at scale without reinventing the wheel for every project.

*   **Efficiency:** Systems bridge the gap between design and development, reducing the friction of handoffs and speeding up production [4, 19].
*   **Trust:** In a fragmented media landscape, visual consistency builds trust. A design system ensures that whether a stakeholder reads an email, visits a microsite, or attends a webinar, the experience feels cohesive [24].
*   **COPE Strategy:** Efficient teams use a "Create Once, Publish Everywhere" (COPE) strategy. Instead of creating bespoke content for every channel, they repurpose core assets systematically, maximizing the reach of limited resources [5].

## The Accessibility & Technology Mandate

Digital accessibility is often the clearest litmus test for a foundation's communications maturity. While many organizations issue mandates on equity and inclusion, their digital presence often tells a different story.

### The Compliance Gap
The gap between intent and execution is stark. Recent audits show that **56%** of public sector and nonprofit websites lack a basic accessibility statement, and very few achieve top accessibility scores [6]. This is not just a technical failure; it is a failure of mission. If a foundation's knowledge is locked behind inaccessible PDFs or poorly coded websites, it is effectively excluding a portion of the population it aims to serve.

### Inclusive Design as Default
Leading foundations treat accessibility as a non-negotiable component of their infrastructure, not a compliance checklist to review at the end. When the Ford Foundation underwent its rebrand, accessibility was a primary driver. They prioritized readability, contrast, and navigation from the outset, viewing "inclusive design" as an extension of their social justice mission [21].

This requires a Unified Communications Architecture (UCA)—an integrated tech stack that allows data and content to flow freely and accessibly across platforms, rather than being trapped in siloed tools [22].

## Conclusion: The Maturity Checklist

The shift from Service Bureau to Core Infrastructure is an evolution. It requires moving away from comfortable, linear processes toward more integrated, complex workflows. However, the payoff is a communication function that drives strategy rather than just describing it.

Below is a comparison of the operational shifts required:

| Feature | The Old Way (Service Bureau) | The New Way (Strategic Partner) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Support function; "make it pretty" | Core infrastructure; strategic partner |
| **Timing** | Involved at the end (dissemination) | Involved at inception (co-creation) |
| **Staffing** | Reliance on "unicorns" (heroic effort) | Systems and specialized roles |
| **Budget** | Ad-hoc; "find the money" | Dedicated, autonomous budget |
| **Design** | Inconsistent; reinventing the wheel | Robust Design Systems; reusable assets |
| **Accessibility** | Afterthought or compliance check | Integrated; "inclusive by default" |

Foundations that make these shifts do not just look better; they perform better. They are more resilient in crises, more efficient with their resources, and more effective at driving the social change they seek.
