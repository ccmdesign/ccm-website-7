# How To Get More Traffic To Your Website

*Published: April 3, 2024*

Content Creation, Email List, and SEO tips. These strategies will increase your website's visibility and help you engage your audience.

Driving traffic to your website doesn't have to be a challenging task. By focusing on three strategies—Content Creation, Email List, and SEO tips—you can not only increase your website's visibility but also forge a deeper connection with your audience.

These types of content are examples of the **Inbound Marketing** strategy. Inbound Marketing involves **creating valuable experiences and content tailored to your specific audience.**

This strategy transforms how you connect with your audience, helps you engage the community, and attracts new donors, partners, and volunteers to your non-profit organization.

Here, you'll find some suggestions on how to apply this strategy to your content creation, email list, and website SEO optimization to reach the right person with the right strategy at the right time.

## Define your target persona

Before creating website content (blog posts, videos, podcasts), you need to define your target audience.

**The foundation of any successful content is a deep understanding of your target persona** **(also sometimes known as a buyer persona)**, a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and actual data about your existing customers.

Understanding their needs, challenges, job roles, and lifestyles helps you tailor your content to speak directly to them.

## Create an Inbound Marketing Strategy

In the digital marketing world, content is king, especially when it comes to inbound marketing. But not just any content—value-driven, engaging, and informative content that resonates with your audience's needs and curiosities.

**💡Idea:** Save time and resources by repurposing your content to create new marketing assets, which costs far less than creating entirely new content.

**For example, create the following content list from your blog post:**

- Short versions of posts for use in newsletters or social media with links back to full posts;
- Visual content to share on social
- Infographics with post information

Since you won't be distributing each piece immediately, your content pipeline is always full.

## Do some SEO research

Once you know who you're talking to, the next step is to discover what they're searching for. SEO research unveils the keywords and phrases your target audience uses when seeking solutions online. This insight ensures that the content you produce is not just relevant but also discoverable.

To do this, you can utilize SEO tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify high-ranking keywords within your niche. Then, take the information you learn from Keyword Planner and use Google Trends to fill in some blanks. Integrate these naturally into your blog posts to boost visibility.

## Publish with intention

Publishing your blog post is more than just clicking a button. It involves optimizing your content for search engines to ensure it reaches your intended audience. This means paying attention to meta descriptions, titles, headings, and keyword density.

## Create your email list

Email marketing can be a powerful tool for driving traffic to your website. With the right strategy, you can use email campaigns to reach your target audience, build relationships with donors and volunteers, and ultimately increase your website's traffic and conversions.

**💡Ideas:**

- Sign-Up Incentives: Offer valuable resources as an incentive for signing up to your email list. This could be a free ebook, a white paper, or access to a webinar.
- Regular Newsletters: Send a weekly newsletter with your newest content and recent blog posts, and provide updates on ongoing research or projects.
- Monthly emails with donation needs and opportunities: Set up an email sequence for new subscribers to thank them for joining and educate them about your organization.

When creating your email marketing, divide the content into blocks. This will help you build a narrative that engages the reader, breaking down objections and increasing the chances of them engaging with your email and taking the desired action at the end.

Build a content list with blocks using a few topics (this structure is from Cody Burch, an email marketing specialist):

- What they want
- Why they want it
- Their fears
- Their false beliefs
- Connecting with history
- What you have
- How you found it
- What it does for them
- Why it's important
- How to get it

**Using these topics, you can make the content readable and actionable.** Make sure to show the visitors not just what you made or do but what difference you made possible for your client.

With these strategies, you can create compelling content that speaks directly to the minds and hearts of your prospects.

**Paying attention to how this content is delivered, i.e., the user experience when they arrive at your site, is also essential.** After all, there's no point in getting them there if your website isn't well laid out, easy to use, and attractive.

The whole process of acquisition and retention needs to be about helping, not trapping people.

With this information, a lot of planning, and professional help, you can have great results for your organization. Let us know if you are going to start your inbound marketing strategy. Let's build this together!
