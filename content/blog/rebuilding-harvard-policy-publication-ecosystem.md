excerpt: See how we transformed Harvard’s Belfer and Shorenstein Centers from static PDFs to dynamic digital product ecosystems using a product-led UX strategy.
tldr: |-
  - **The Shift:** We transitioned Harvard's Belfer and Shorenstein Centers from legacy, event-based, and static PDF models to dynamic, user-centric digital product ecosystems.
  - **The Methodology:** Success required a "Product Mindset" rather than a "Web Design" mindset, prioritizing user needs and strategic longevity over simple aesthetics.
  - **The Architecture:** We built scalable systems—one an archive-based casebook, the other a central data hub—that accommodate future growth without requiring a rebuild.
  - **The Outcome:** The new platforms increased accessibility, amplified reach to industry leaders (from Sundance to Google), and preserved the institution's authoritative brand equity.

  The digital transformation of policy publication systems represents a critical evolution in how academic and research institutions disseminate knowledge. For decades, the standard for prestige was physical: the heavy printed report, the exclusive roundtable, the packed auditorium for an award ceremony. However, as audiences fragment and digital consumption becomes the primary mode of engagement, these legacy formats often trap valuable insights in inaccessible silos.

## The Challenge: Moving Beyond the PDF

For many institutions, the "digital strategy" has historically been simple: upload the PDF to the website. While this preserves the record, it fails the user. Static documents are difficult to parse on mobile devices, do not support interactive data exploration, and often bury key findings under dense academic text [1].

Our engagement with Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy was precipitated by a crisis that exposed these limitations: the COVID-19 pandemic.

### The Catalyst: Crisis as an Innovation Driver
The Technology and Public Purpose (TAPP) Project at the Belfer Center had a specific challenge. They were preparing to launch the "Tech Spotlight," an initiative to recognize technologies serving the public good. Originally conceived as a physical award ceremony—complete with the networking, prestige, and stagecraft that implies—the pandemic rendered a live event impossible.

The challenge was not merely to "put the content online." It was to translate the *experience* of an award ceremony into a digital product. How do you replicate the weight of a Harvard award, the celebration of the winners, and the depth of the case studies without a physical stage? A standard blog post or press release would have diluted the initiative's impact immediately [2].

### The Data Dilemma
Simultaneously, the Shorenstein Center faced a different, yet equally complex challenge with their "Indie Film Landscape" project. They possessed a massive, data-driven study on the crisis in independent film distribution. The research identified a market gap of 40 million viewers—a finding that could reshape the industry [3].

However, a traditional white paper would have failed to capture the dynamic nature of this data. The target audience—filmmakers, studio executives, and policymakers—needed to visualize the market gap, not just read about it. The legacy system of static publication would have rendered this actionable data inert.

For an evaluator assessing digital partners, these scenarios pose critical questions: How do you migrate high-stakes reputation content without diluting the brand? And how do you build a system that works not just for one report, but for the next five years of research?

## Our Approach: A User-Centric Methodology

Rebuilding these systems required moving beyond a "web design" project mentality. We approached this as a product strategy engagement, employing a rigorous methodology rooted in User Experience (UX) strategy to ensure the final architecture aligned with both institutional objectives and user needs.

### Phase 1: UX Assessment and Strategy
We never begin with "how it should look." We begin with "who it is for." The foundation of the rebuild was a "UX Assessment & Strategy" phase [4].

We worked with the client teams to uncover the core information architecture. This involved mapping institutional objectives—such as "recognize technologies for public good"—against the specific constraints of the users. For a policy publication, the user is often a time-poor staffer, a journalist on a deadline, or an executive browsing on a commute. They do not have time to wade through a 100-page PDF to find the single statistic that matters to them [5].

This phase resulted in a recommendations report that served as the blueprint. It defined the intersection between the institution's desire to broadcast complexity and the user's need to consume clarity.

### Phase 2: Brand Architecture and the "Crown" Concept
A critical challenge in the university context is managing Brand Architecture. When launching a new initiative like the Tech Spotlight, the design must be distinct enough to feel innovative but respectful enough of the parent brand to retain authority. If it looks too different, it loses the "Harvard" weight; if it looks too similar, it gets lost in the noise of the department website.

For the Tech Spotlight, we developed the "Crown" concept. We identified two abstract concepts derived from the project's function: "spotlight" (illumination) and "crown" (recognition). The resulting logo featured stage lights flashing to form a crown shape. This allowed the project to have a "remarkable" identity—a sub-brand that stood on its own—while utilizing the foundational Harvard color scheme to ensure the public immediately recognized the link to the University [6].

### Phase 3: From Event to Product
The shift from "event" to "product" required a fundamental rethinking of the user journey. For the Tech Spotlight, the briefing shifted from branding event materials to Product Design. The digital platform had to serve the function of the ceremony: highlighting winners like Google's AI Model Cards and Thorn's Spotlight tool while providing deep dives into their work.

We treated the publication as a product with a lifecycle. It wasn't a static document to be uploaded and forgotten; it was a living system designed to engage users, facilitate discovery, and archive excellence over time.

## Execution: Two Paths to Digital Transformation

The strategy phase revealed that while both centers needed digital transformation, they required different architectural solutions. This highlights the importance of custom strategy over rigid templates.

### Case A: The Belfer Center "Tech Spotlight" (The Archive Model)
For the Tech Spotlight, the goal was to create a digital "Hall of Fame."

*   **The Build:** We created a dedicated website and digital publication—a "Casebook"—that showcased finalists and winners.
*   **The Feature:** The architecture was modular, designed to accommodate annual cohorts (2019, 2020, 2021). This scalability allowed the Belfer Center to simply "pour" new content into the existing architecture each year. The site serves as an archive, with clear navigation that allows users to toggle between different years' recipients without leaving the ecosystem [7].
*   **The Experience:** To replicate the engagement of a live event, the platform integrated multimedia content, including virtual "fireside chats." This turned a static list of names into a dynamic exploration of ethical technology [2].

### Case B: The Shorenstein Center "Indie Film Landscape" (The Hub Model)
For the Indie Film Landscape study, the goal was clarity and utility.

*   **The Build:** We constructed a "central hub" model at indiefilmlandscape.org. This was not just a landing page for a PDF download; it was a native digital experience [8].
*   **The Feature:** We implemented a layered information architecture. High-level visual findings were presented directly on the web for casual evaluators and executives who needed the "headline" data immediately. For researchers requiring granular detail, deep-dive reports were available as secondary downloads.
*   **The Experience:** The UX priority was ensuring that complex research on audience fragmentation was accessible to non-academic audiences. By visualizing the data—showing the 40 million viewer gap graphically—we made the research actionable for studio executives who might otherwise ignore a text-heavy academic paper [6].

## The Results: Measurable Impact

The migration from legacy formats to digital ecosystems drove tangible results that validated the investment in UX strategy.

**Reach and Engagement**
The Indie Film study's digital hub successfully communicated the "market gap" of roughly 40-77 million viewers to the people who could act on it. By presenting this data in an accessible web format, the research reached industry leaders effectively, sparking dialogue at major venues like the Sundance Film Festival and garnering coverage in *IndieWire* and *Filmmaker Magazine* [3, 9].

**Prestige Retention**
The Tech Spotlight platform proved that a digital venue could hold the same weight as a physical stage. The platform successfully hosted and highlighted global tech giants (Google, IBM) alongside critical NGOs (Thorn, ACLU). The high-fidelity design and seamless user experience maintained the prestige of the award, ensuring that recipients felt truly honored despite the lack of a physical ceremony [2, 10].

**Longevity and Utility**
Unlike a physical event which is ephemeral, or a PDF which often becomes "shelf-ware," these digital systems continue to provide value. The Tech Spotlight archives remain a searchable database of ethical technology precedents, and the Indie Film hub serves as a persistent resource for the industry.

## What This Means for Your Organization

If you are evaluating partners for a similar digital transformation, this case study offers three critical takeaways for your decision-making process:

### 1. Adopt the Product Mindset
The most successful policy publications are no longer just reports; they are products. They have users, they have features, and they have lifecycles. Look for a partner who understands **Product & UX Strategy**, not just visual design. The success of your publication depends on how well it solves a user's problem, not just how good it looks.

### 2. Scalability is Key
In the Evaluator stage, you must consider the long-term cost of ownership. The "Legacy" approach often requires designing a new PDF or microsite for every single report. The approach we utilized for Harvard—building modular, scalable architectures—means you invest in the system once and leverage it for years. The Tech Spotlight handled multiple annual cycles without a code rebuild because we planned for the future during the initial strategy phase.

### 3. Brand Equity Can Be Managed
There is often a fear that moving away from the standard institutional template will "hurt the brand." As the "Crown" concept demonstrates, it is possible to create a distinct, innovative sub-brand that actually *enhances* the parent institution's authority. Strategic branding allows you to highlight specific initiatives while maintaining the trust and weight of your organization.
