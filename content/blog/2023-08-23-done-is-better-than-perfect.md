# Done is Better than Perfect and the Nature of the Web

*Published: August 23, 2023*

The art of avoiding weedless perfectionism and embracing continuous improvement

## TLDR

The article argues against chasing perfection in website design, which can delay launch and benefits. It advocates launching a quality minimum viable product swiftly instead. Renowned experts are cited, like Steve Krug ("good enough design") and Luke Wroblewski ("shipping beats perfection"). The key is to define an MVP, view launch as a milestone, set reasonable timelines, and focus on iterative progress over perfection. This results in faster launch and a better client-firm relationship.

## Introduction

It's natural to want a flawless website before launch, but chasing perfection can undermine results. This article explains when done is better than perfect for web design clients.

## The Elusive Dream of Perfection

Steve Krug coined "good enough design" to argue sites just need basic usability, not perfection. As he states in Don't Make Me Think, "It's not necessary to achieve design perfection." Pursuing pixel perfection across browsers is likely futile, as Jeffrey Zeldman notes. Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation across devices is preferable to endless tweaking.

According to Zeldman, targeting specific browsers over systems is problematic. Variations in CSS support make true consistency impossible. As Jakob Nielsen's 80/20 rule states, fix the biggest compatibility issues but don't waste time on every minor quirk. For example, a menu functioning correctly but sitting a few pixels lower on one browser likely isn't worth extensive rework and delaying launch.

## Defining a Minimum Viable Product

The minimum viable product (MVP) concept is key, as coined by Eric Ries and popularized in Joel Spolsky's "Worse is Better" philosophy. An MVP prioritizes core features over polish and provides clear "approved" launch criteria without endless lingering revisions, as Ries states.

## Iterative Improvement Over Perfection

Krug's "good enough" design principle recognizes launching an MVP is not the final state. As he states, "What matters is succeeding fast at tasks. Not quality of design but quality of experience." Post-launch, user data and feedback fuel iterative improvement. Facebook famously launched in 2004 with minimal features yet constant iterations drove explosive growth. Think of launch as a milestone, not the finish line.

## Reasonable Timelines

In Mobile First, Luke Wroblewski states "Shipping beats perfection." Quick delivery of value beats endless tweaks. But as Jeffrey Zeldman warns, scope creep causes projects to balloon in timelines and budgets. Approach tweaks cautiously to avoid runaway costs.

## Conclusion

By avoiding needless perfectionism, you'll launch faster and realize benefits sooner. Done is better than perfect. Keep the big picture in mind, embrace iteration, and pick your battles. Your webdesign firm will appreciate a thoughtful partner focused on achieving efficient results.
