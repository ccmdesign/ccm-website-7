*Published: June 30, 2023*

Making Life Easier for Citizens

## Introduction

### Human-Centred Design to Digital Government

There's no denying that technology is dramatically reshaping our world and how we engage with it. Government services may be trailing in some parts of the globe, but the reality is much brighter in some countries. Certain pioneering nations are leading the charge in digital government services, offering us a tantalizing peek into the potential of this revolution. They've taken impressive strides in crafting government services that are swift, readily available, and notably user-friendly, effectively reimagining how citizens and government interact.

We're ready to take a deep dive into this rich topic through this series of articles. We'll tackle the concepts of the future of digital government services and tap into the insights of some of the brightest minds in this field. We'll unpack the cruciality of a user-centric design, explore how various departments can synchronize their efforts more effectively, and probe into what it truly means for a service to be reliable, high-performing, and mindful of users' time and effort (and patience!).

Our journey that will traverse the spectrum from standout instances of global digital governance to an intensive exploration of the potential hurdles that this transformation might present. This series' primary aim is to illuminate the ever-evolving landscape of government digital services, offering a more profound comprehension and initiating a thought-provoking discussion about what the future might hold.

And here's the kicker: your thoughts, personal experiences, and perspectives are absolutely pivotal to this exploration. So, let's dive into this fascinating realm of digital governance together, unraveling its complex layers and envisaging its promising future. Buckle up for the journey?

## Users First and no Department Walls

In the epic of modern public service, a crucial subplot has got us all on the edge of our seats - the push for a user-first design and a tight-knit integration between departments. The goal here isn't just about getting digital solutions up and running; it's about crafting solutions that are genuinely people-centered, intuitive, and slicing through red tape like a hot knife through butter. Need a guiding star? Look no further than the book "Digital Transformation at Scale: Why the Strategy Is Delivery" by Mike Bracken and crew, who took on the herculean task of bringing the UK government's digital services into the 21st century.

Let's take a moment to appreciate the dramatic U-turn by the Government Digital Service (GDS) in the UK. These guys were handed the enormous challenge of digitizing public services, and boy, they took it on. Their rally cry? 'Start with user needs, not government needs.' This led to a total reimagining of online government services, be it tax filing or disability benefits applications, with the user's needs and experiences front and center.

Take a look at the 'GOV.UK' initiative by GDS. Instead of leaving users wandering through a maze of government departments, GDS took hundreds of departmental websites and funneled them into a user-friendly platform, GOV.UK. They made the user interface easier to navigate, using clear English and a powerful search function one step ahead of what users likely need.

And let's not forget about their monumental effort to smash down those information silos between departments. In the old days, getting departments to share information was as easy as herding cats. One symptom of this issue was the repeated request for the same information from citizens. The GDS tackled this head-on, encouraging better integration between departments. This meant info from a citizen's interaction with one department could be smoothly shared with others, making service delivery a whole lot slicker.

But let's not kid ourselves; morphing into an integrated, user-focused system isn't a walk in the park. It involves dealing with challenges like:

- Turning the tide of entrenched bureaucratic culture.
- Safeguarding data privacy and security.
- Managing the sheer logistical mammoth that is the transformation.

As "Digital Transformation at Scale" lays bare, the journey requires an iterative design, constant user testing, and an ironclad commitment to keep user needs at the center of service delivery.

The GDS's metamorphosis is a shining example of a user-first design and cross-department integration in public services. It's a tale of innovation and grit, bridging the gulf between the current state and a more utopian vision. And the story isn't over; governments worldwide are scrambling to mirror and enhance the GDS's triumphs.

These revolutions pose pivotal questions. How can other governments tailor these principles to their unique situations? How will the quest for integrated, user-first public services evolve with fresh technologies? As we delve into these questions, we edge closer to redefining the bond between citizens and their governments in the digital age.

## Dependability and Efficiency

Shifting public services into the digital dimension opens up a potential for enhanced dependability and supercharged efficiency. It's a pledge built on rock-solid service delivery, swift response times, and the satisfaction of users. In this sphere, Darrell M. West's book "Digital Government: Technology and Public Sector Performance" is a critical roadmap, spotlighting technology's role in boosting government output and sparking innovation.

One exemplary case that personifies these principles is Estonia, often dubbed the globe's most digitally progressive society. As West brings to light, Estonia has engineered a sturdy digital network, 'e-Estonia,' marked by remarkable dependability and stellar efficiency.

The odyssey of e-Estonia kicked off with a digital ID, a legal stand-in for a physical ID, granting citizens access to various public services online. Now, services from voting to tax filing or even launching a business are just a few clicks away. The system's dependability springs from its technical strength and effective safety measures, incorporating advanced encryption and blockchain tech to safeguard data integrity.

Yet, the system's efficiency isn't just about service speed; it's also about how it streamlines government operations. West underlines, for example, how Estonia's tax filing system allows citizens to submit their taxes in mere minutes, leading to substantial cost reductions, better tax collection, and less red tape.

However, this isn't solely a tale of national governments. On the city scale, we see riveting examples of how digital tools can ramp up dependability and efficiency. Take the city of Boston, for instance. They launched 'BOS:311,' a mobile app for non-emergency city services, allowing citizens to report issues like potholes or broken streetlights directly to the city. West points out that this has sped up the resolution of these issues and boosted citizen satisfaction by making the city government more responsive.

Reflecting on these examples poses some thought-provoking questions. How can governments guarantee the dependability of increasingly intricate digital services? How should we assess the efficiency of digital government initiatives? And how can we harness technology to reinvent the relationship between citizens and their governments? Hunting for these answers, we delve deeper into digital governance, navigating its boundless possibilities and significant hurdles.

## Consistency and Clear Everyday Language

In the realm of public services, maintaining a uniform design and employing clear, everyday language is key to crafting digital platforms that are accessible and easy to navigate. This idea resonates within Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things," in which he stresses that transparent communication and design uniformity are fundamental to crafting user-friendly experiences.

Uniformity in a government design system encompasses both visual and functional elements. Visual uniformity is about consistently applying color palettes, typography, and layout across multiple government websites or apps. This uniformity instills a sense of familiarity in users, facilitating their navigation across different government platforms. Functional uniformity, in contrast, focuses on ensuring similar tasks operate consistently across platforms, thereby minimizing the cognitive burden on users.

Consider the United States Web Design System (USWDS) as an illustration. The USWDS provides a suite of design guidelines and code templates to maintain a unified look and feel across government websites. By encouraging both visual and functional uniformity, the USWDS simplifies citizen interactions with their government online.

Parallel to this, the importance of employing clear, everyday language in public services cannot be overstated. Norman champions a key principle to "speak the users' language." In the context of government, this means discarding bureaucratic terminology in favor of straightforward language and easily understood by the average citizen.

This principle is brought to life by the US government's 'plain language' initiative, which requires federal agencies to use clear communication that the public can understand and engage with. An offshoot of this initiative, the 'plainlanguage.gov' website, offers resources and guidelines to government agencies on crafting clear and concise content.

However, actualizing uniformity and simplicity in government digital services presents its own set of challenges. How can governments ensure uniformity across myriad departments and agencies, each with its own unique considerations? How can they strike a balance between using simple language and maintaining legal precision in public communication? Posing these questions invites us further into the complex process of designing government digital services that are functional, user-friendly, and accessible to all.

## Wrapping Up

As we round off this inaugural chapter of our series, we've dissected the critical roles 'Reliability and Performance' and 'Consistency and Clear, Everyday Language' play in shaping digital government services.

We've taken a page from Estonia, observing firsthand how a nation can revolutionize its digital services, ensuring unvarying delivery, swift response, and robust user satisfaction. Urban initiatives, such as Boston's 'BOS:311', have demonstrated the power of digital tools in fostering city governments that are more responsive and efficient. These examples underscore the gravity of offering reliable digital services that perform at their peak.

Further, we've immersed ourselves in the principle of design uniformity and the imperative of using clear, everyday language. With insights from Don Norman as our guide, we've uncovered how these principles can render digital platforms more navigable and accessible to the average citizen. The US Web Design System and the 'plain language' initiative have set the bar high.

However, our voyage toward constructing efficient, accessible, and user-friendly government digital services is just setting sail. It beckons us to plunge deeper into the complex process of designing digital platforms that are truly aligned with citizen needs.

As we draw the curtains on this part of our journey, we eagerly anticipate the next chapter, where we will delve into 'Feedback and Form Optimization' and 'Respect the User, Value Their Time and Effort.'

Come along as I continue to traverse the nuances of government digital services and envision the horizon of digital governance. Your thoughts and insights are not just welcome, but they're also a vital part of this ongoing conversation. Stay connected!
