# Technology & Policy: Making Facebook Canada’s Policy Initiatives Tangible

*Brand systems and digital experiences that made policy work legible for Canadians across publications and microsites.*

**The Client:** Facebook Canada’s Policy and Research teams chart social impact stories across the country  
**The Challenge:** Present complex policy narratives and multiple initiatives with limited time and disparate audiences while staying inside Facebook’s visual language  
**The Solution:** Publication design for reports and memos, microsite flows for the Election Integrity and Connectivity initiatives, and simple storytelling for the Hard Questions roundtables  
**The Impact:** Multiple assets launched globally; the templates we build for Canada were reused for India, Mexico, Latin America, and Sweden with positive internal feedback

## The Strategic Challenge

Facebook Canada’s policy work spans publications, training memos, microsites, and live events. Each initiative had its own audience—from political teams seeking to understand election integrity, to remote communities sharing connectivity stories, to citizens browsing “Hard Questions” discussions. The brand language had to match Facebook’s global identity while also aligning with Canadian expectations for trustworthiness and clarity.

With new programs emerging quickly, the teams could not rely on bespoke assets for every launch. They needed flexible yet grounded systems to keep deliverables aligned with the larger policy mission.

## Our Approach & Key Decisions

We anchored everything in storytelling and usability.

**Publications as briefs:** We shaped memos, annual reports, and “Hard Questions” summaries into publication templates that balanced visuals with digestible copy. Each document prioritized legibility and highlighted policy impact through bold pull quotes and simplified data treatments. These templates were later reused for other countries because they respected Facebook’s standards while adapting to local nuance.

**Microsites with clear flows:** For the Election Integrity initiative, we designed a manual-like tutorial for politicians, later evolved into a public microsite. The site showcased security features and resources while guiding visitors through actions. We applied a similar approach to the Connectivity project: event listings, submission forms for remote communities, and narrative story blocks told the human side of rural internet adoption.

**Human-centered storytelling:** “Hard Questions” roundtables required live event highlights and recordings. We prioritized simple navigation, intuitive layouts, and video-friendly placements so audiences could jump from livestreams to thought leadership without friction.

## The Solution

**Cross-cutting identity:** Even as deliverables varied—from reports to websites—we kept the visual system cohesive with consistent color treatments, typography, and modular layouts. This made new launches feel like part of a single initiative even if different teams produced them.

**Iterative toolkit:** Each engagement produced reusable components (e.g., hero layouts, resource cards, forms). Teams could deploy them for future initiatives without reinventing the wheel.

**Impact storytelling:** We collaborated with the policy teams to surface data, quotes, and stories that proved the value of their work. The designs served as both information portals and earned-trust experiences.

## The Measurable Impact

**Global template adoption:** The Canadian playbook inspired localized versions for India, Mexico, Latin America, and Sweden, proving the system’s adaptability.

**Stronger policy communications:** Politicians, remote communities, and citizens all had new touchpoints for understanding Facebook’s policy work—making the initiatives more transparent and actionable.

**Enduring partnership:** Facebook’s policy teams kept returning with new mandates, signaling trust in our ability to translate policy into tangible experiences.
