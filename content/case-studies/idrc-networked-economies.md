# International Development: Networked Economies for IDRC

*Designing publications that decode emerging tech for development leaders.*

**The Client:** International Development Research Centre funds research on technology’s role in equitable development  
**The Challenge:** Present dense research on blockchain, AI, and gender equity in ways that are accessible to public servants and NGO experts  
**The Solution:** Custom infographics, typographic clarity, and narrative layouts that highlighted the social development implications of each topic  
**The Impact:** Long-form reports remained readable, and the visual approach helped IDRC extend the Networked Economies series to new funders and audiences

## The Strategic Challenge

IDRC’s Networked Economies initiative explores how technologies like blockchain, AI, and gender-responsive policies impact communities in the Global South. Each report mixes advanced analysis with stories from public servants, meaning the design needed to live in both academic and practical worlds.

The main challenge was distilling technical research—large, text-heavy, and conceptually complex—into accessible narratives without diluting rigor. We also had to deliver under tight editorial timelines as reports often tied to annual conferences and funding rounds.

## Our Approach & Key Decisions

**Conceptual infographics:** Every publication opened with graphics that explained big ideas visually. For instance, blockchain’s trust implications were mapped through simple flows, while AI’s governance effects came alive via annotated personas.

**Typographic clarity:** The reports exceeded 100 pages, so legibility was paramount. We used generous spacing, scalable headings, and a typographic hierarchy that guided readers whether they skimmed or dug deeper.

**Narrative hooks:** Pull quotes, story boxes, and timeline callouts highlighted the human impact of each technology. This kept public-sector audiences engaged and illustrated why the research mattered on the ground.

## The Solution

**Report templates:** We provided layouts that handled dense tables, quotes, and case studies without feeling overwhelming. Editors could slot in new chapters while preserving visual coherence.

**Visual storytelling for funders:** Presentation-ready assets distilled the research for funders, making it easier to share insights in boardrooms or panels.

**Supporting collateral:** In addition to the main reports, we produced companion briefs (e.g., Fogo report, gender-focused future releases) that kept the Networked Economies story moving through multiple formats.

## The Measurable Impact

**Readable long-form:** The reports stayed accessible even as they grew more ambitious—a testament to the balance of rigor and narrative in the design system.

**Advancing credibility:** The clear presentation helped IDRC showcase the social impact of emerging technologies to a wider audience, including governments and funders.

**Series that moves forward:** The visual approach became the playbook for future publications, ensuring consistency across AI, blockchain, gender, and related research.
