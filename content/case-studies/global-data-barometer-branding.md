# Data for Public Good: Branding the Global Data Barometer

*A visual system that mirrors the four-dimensional scorecard powering data governance insights.*

**The Client:** Global Data Barometer maps how governments deploy data for public good  
**The Challenge:** Translate a multi-dimensional data mapping framework into a cohesive visual identity  
**The Solution:** Logo and brand assets that incorporate the four Barometer dimensions, paired with flexible systems for reports and presentations  
**The Impact:** Global Data Barometer launched a recognizable brand that reinforced their mission and made complex findings more approachable

## The Strategic Challenge

Global Data Barometer tracks four dimensions of how governments use data—availability, openness, adoption, and stewardship—across the globe. The team needed a brand that felt rigorous yet approachable, one that could visually express the interconnected nature of these dimensions without overwhelming audiences.

The previous visual language did not reflect the Barometer’s analytical rigor, and future materials (reports, presentations, and outreach assets) required an identity that could carry the narrative forward.

## Our Approach & Key Decisions

**Dimensional mark:** We designed a logo system inspired by the four-dimensional radar chart the Barometer uses internally. Each quadrant tied to a data dimension, and the mark could animate or expand to highlight whichever dimension was in focus.

**Flexible palettes:** Rather than a single set of colors, we created palettes for each dimension. This allowed every chart, slide, or report to feel connected while giving the team expressive freedom to emphasize the insights they were sharing.

**Narrative-ready assets:** Icons, textures, and typography were built to support storytelling. The identity system integrated with the Barometer’s research outputs so that each publication immediately felt like part of the same program.

## The Solution

**Report-ready templates:** We supplied layout templates that could host the rich data the Barometer produces. Tables, explanations, and callouts maintained hierarchy through thoughtful spacing and typographic contrast.

**Presentation toolkits:** Teams could quickly assemble decks for workshops or speaking engagements using pre-approved visual assets, keeping presentations on-brand even when produced rapidly.

**Storytelling graphics:** Custom iconography and graphic treatments helped non-technical audiences understand each dimension, making the data feel directional rather than purely academic.

## The Measurable Impact

**Consistent global identity:** The new system made the Barometer instantly recognizable across reports and events.

**Easier storytelling:** Researchers could now publish insights with templates that conveyed authority without sacrificing clarity.

**Program amplification:** With the holistic identity, the Barometer’s mission resonated more clearly with funders, partners, and governments.
