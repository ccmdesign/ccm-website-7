# Government of Canada

The Government of Canada governs and serves over 38 million citizens through departments that deliver services ranging from healthcare and safety to innovation and climate action. Its national initiatives shape policy and programs that keep the country resilient and inclusive.

## About the Government of Canada

Federal departments collaborate with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, and partners to steer economic stability, social equity, and environmental stewardship. Transparency, evidence-based policy, and citizen-centred design guide how programs are delivered across the country.

## Our Work Together

We worked with Government of Canada teams to modernize citizen-facing digital services, clarifying complex policy journeys, improving accessibility, and deploying systems that scale across ministries while keeping Canadians informed and engaged.
