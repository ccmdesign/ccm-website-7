# Open Society Foundations

Open Society Foundations works to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens. The foundation supports efforts to advance justice, education, public health, and independent media in more than 120 countries.

## About Open Society Foundations

Founded by George Soros, Open Society Foundations is one of the largest private funders of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights. The foundation partners with local communities and organizations to address the root causes of inequality and injustice.

## Our Work Together

We've collaborated with Open Society Foundations on digital transformation projects that help them communicate their impact, streamline grantee reporting, and connect their global network of partners and advocates.
