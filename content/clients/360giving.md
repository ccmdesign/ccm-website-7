# 360Giving

360Giving is a philanthropic data organization that helps funders publish their grants data in an open, standardized way. Their work connects funders and communities across the UK, making grant funding more transparent and effective.

## About 360Giving

360Giving supports funders to publish their grants data openly, and helps people to understand and use this data to improve charitable giving. They provide the 360Giving Data Standard, tools, and guidance to help funders share data about their funding.

## Our Work Together

We've helped 360Giving develop comprehensive design systems and digital infrastructure that enable their team to build products independently while maintaining consistency across their digital ecosystem.
