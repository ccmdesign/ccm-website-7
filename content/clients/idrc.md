# International Development Research Centre (IDRC)

The International Development Research Centre funds and supports research that empowers communities and governments in the Global South to solve pressing development challenges. IDRC champions collaborative, locally-led innovation that advances equitable economic growth and resilient systems.

## About IDRC

Operating from Ottawa, IDRC invests in research spanning health, climate, digital ecosystems, and democratic resilience. Its global partnerships emphasize co-creation, capacity building, and long-term impact tracking to ensure research informs policy and practice sustainably.

## Our Work Together

We helped IDRC redesign its partner-facing microsites and internal playbooks so teams could quickly showcase impact stories, surface insights from grantees, and keep knowledge sharing consistent across regions.
