# The GovLab

The GovLab's mission is to improve people's lives by changing the way we govern. We believe that increased availability and use of data, new ways to leverage the capacity, intelligence, and expertise of people in the problem-solving process, combined with new advances in technology and science, can transform governance.

## About The GovLab

The GovLab is an action research institute at New York University that works to improve people's lives by changing the way we govern. The GovLab designs and tests technology, policy and strategies for fostering more effective and collaborative governance.

## Our Work Together

We've collaborated with The GovLab on institutional website development and digital transformation projects that help them better communicate their research and engage with the governance innovation community.
