# Case Study Formatter Agent Instructions

## Agent Purpose
The case-study-formatter agent standardizes individual case study frontmatter AND formats content structure according to CCM's established patterns. This agent processes ONE specific case study at a time, checking if formatting work is necessary and applying only the required formatting components for that specific case study.

**Agent Invocation**: The agent should be called with a specific case study file path that needs to be processed. The agent will analyze that single file and determine what formatting work (if any) is needed.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Frontmatter Standardization
- Validate and update frontmatter to CCM's 2025 case study structure
- Generate missing fields based on content analysis  
- Ensure proper brow/title formatting
- Create compelling taglines and client-focused descriptions
- Support both Full Case Studies and Portfolio item formats

### 2. Content Structure Formatting
- Wrap content in appropriate CCM content components
- Add structural sections based on content length and case study type
- Ensure proper heading hierarchies
- Add required closing sections

## Case Study Types

### Full Case Studies
Comprehensive, detailed project stories with:
- Strategic challenge analysis
- Approach and key decisions
- Complete solution breakdown
- Measurable impact with client testimonials
- Call-to-action sections

### Portfolio Items
Shorter, visual showcases with:
- Project overview and key metrics
- Visual presentation focus
- Concise impact statements
- Client and solution highlights

## Frontmatter Standards

### Required Fields Structure for Full Case Studies
```yaml
---
brow: "Client Type or Industry Category"
title: "Main Impact Statement or Achievement"
tagline: "Compelling description of transformation or results achieved"
client: "Client Name"
client-slug: "client-name-for-urls"
challenge: "Brief description of the main challenge addressed"
solution: "Concise description of the solution provided"
impact: "Key measurable outcome or achievement"
published: true
case_type: "full" # Optional: specify case study type
---
```

### Required Fields Structure for Portfolio Items
```yaml
---
brow: "Client Type or Industry Category"
title: "Main Impact Statement or Achievement"

```

### Standardized Client Categories (brow field)
- Academic Institution
- Research Institution
- Policy Research Organization
- Non-Profit Foundation
- Technology Company
- Government Agency
- Healthcare Organization
- Financial Institution
- Media & Publishing
- Professional Services

### Frontmatter Quality Guidelines
- **brow**: Use client type or industry category
- **title**: Focus on impact, achievement, or transformation
- **tagline**: Highlight value proposition, transformation, or key results
- **client**: Official client name
- **client-slug**: URL-friendly version of client name
- **challenge**: Concise problem statement
- **solution**: Brief solution description
- **impact**: Measurable outcome with specifics when possible

### Smart Brow and Title Processing

#### Brow Intelligence
Before modifying the `brow` field, analyze if it's manually created or auto-generated:
- **Keep existing brow** if it's unique/specific and different from standard categories
- **Update brow** only if it appears to be auto-generated or generic
- Manual brows are often more specific than categories (e.g., "Academic Research Center" vs just "Academic Institution")

#### Title Structure Pattern Detection
Detect and restructure titles following impact-focused patterns:

**Pattern to Detect**: `"Client Name: Achievement or Impact"`
**Action**: 
1. Move "Client Name" information to appropriate frontmatter fields
2. Focus title on the achievement or impact
3. Use specific metrics when available

**Examples**:
- Original: `title: "Harvard: Award Brand Attracts Google and IBM"`
- Result: `client: "Harvard"` + `title: "Award Brand Attracts Google, IBM, and NYT Participants"`

## Content Structure Patterns

## Content Structure Guidelines

### Title Structure Requirements
- **Remove all title repetition from content body**
- Case study titles (brow, title, tagline) exist ONLY in frontmatter
- Content should start with opening summary immediately after frontmatter
- No H1 headings that duplicate the frontmatter title
- Remove any existing title/subtitle structures from article body

### Opening Sections
- Start with client/challenge/solution/impact summary
- Use the established pattern: "**The Client:** | **The Challenge:** | **The Solution:** | **The Impact:**"
- Include specific metrics and outcomes when available
- Set context for the project's importance

### Section Organization for Full Case Studies
- Use clear, strategic section headings
- Maintain logical flow: Challenge → Approach → Solution → Impact
- Include client testimonials in impact sections
- Break up long sections with subheadings

### Section Organization for Portfolio Items
- Focus on visual presentation
- Keep text concise and scannable
- Emphasize key metrics and outcomes
- Use gallery sections effectively

### CTA Integration
- Customize CTA based on case study focus area
- Examples:
  - "Ready to Transform Your Brand Identity?"
  - "Ready to Build Your Design System?"
  - "Ready to Launch Your Digital Platform?"
- Include relevant service links at the bottom

## Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] Client name and slug are consistent and URL-friendly
- [ ] Challenge, solution, and impact are concise but descriptive
- [ ] Brow reflects appropriate client category
- [ ] Title focuses on achievement or transformation
- [ ] YAML syntax valid

### Content Structure Validation  
- [ ] **Opening summary present as first content section**
- [ ] **Title/heading repetition removed from content body**
- [ ] All content wrapped in appropriate components
- [ ] **CTA section included at the end**
- [ ] Proper component syntax (`::component-name` opening/closing)
- [ ] Logical section flow maintained for case study type
- [ ] Original voice and meaning preserved
- [ ] Component hierarchy makes sense

## Already-Formatted Detection

### Formatting Status Indicators
To identify if a case study has already been processed by the case-study-formatter, check for these indicators:

#### Required Formatting Markers (ALL must be present):
1. **Complete frontmatter structure** with all required fields including `client-slug`
2. **Content structure** starting with client/challenge/solution/impact summary
3. **CCM content components** wrapping all major content sections
4. **CTA section** present at the end
5. **Proper section hierarchy** based on case study type

#### Quick Detection Method:
```
- Has client-slug field in frontmatter? → Continue checking
- Content starts with client summary pattern? → Continue checking  
- Contains proper section structure? → Continue checking
- Ends with CTA section? → Already formatted, SKIP
```

### Skip Conditions
**SKIP formatting if case study meets ALL criteria:**
- Frontmatter contains `client-slug` field
- First content section follows the client/challenge/solution/impact pattern
- Contains proper section structure for case study type
- Ends with CTA section
- All major content wrapped in appropriate components

### Force Processing Override
Even if a case study appears formatted, STILL PROCESS if:
- User explicitly requests formatting for a specific file
- Frontmatter is incomplete or has obvious errors
- Content structure is broken or malformed

## Single Case Study Processing

### Targeted Processing Approach
The agent processes ONE specific case study at a time with intelligent analysis:

1. **Assess Formatting Need**: Check if the specific case study requires any formatting work
2. **Identify Case Study Type**: Determine if it's a Full Case Study or Portfolio item
3. **Identify Required Components**: Determine which formatting elements are missing or need improvement
4. **Apply Targeted Fixes**: Implement only the necessary changes for that specific case study
5. **Preserve Existing Quality**: Keep well-formatted sections intact

### Smart Processing Logic:
```
1. Read the target case study file
2. Analyze current formatting status:
   - Frontmatter completeness and quality
   - Content structure and component usage
   - Required sections presence
   - Case study type identification
3. If formatting work needed → Apply targeted improvements
4. If already well-formatted → Report status and skip processing
5. Generate summary of changes made (if any)
```

## Implementation Process

### Single Case Study Processing:
1. **Read and Analyze**: Understand the specific case study content, tone, and structure
2. **Assessment Phase**: 
   - Check current formatting status against all requirements
   - Identify case study type (Full vs Portfolio)
   - Identify specific gaps or improvements needed
   - Determine if processing is necessary at all
3. **Targeted Processing** (only if needed):
   - Standardize frontmatter fields that need improvement
   - Analyze content to determine appropriate structural pattern
   - Format content structure with missing components only
   - Remove title repetition if present
   - Add required sections based on case study type
4. **Quality Preservation**: 
   - Maintain original author voice and meaning
   - Keep existing well-formatted sections intact
   - Apply minimal necessary changes
5. **Validation**: Check all syntax and quality standards
6. **Report**: Document specific changes made or confirm no changes needed
