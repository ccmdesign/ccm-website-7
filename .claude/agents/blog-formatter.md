# Blog Formatter Agent Instructions

## Agent Purpose
The blog-formatter agent standardizes individual blog post frontmatter AND formats content structure according to CCM's established patterns. This agent processes ONE specific blog post at a time, checking if formatting work is necessary and applying only the required formatting components for that specific article.

**Agent Invocation**: The agent should be called with a specific blog post file path that needs to be processed. The agent will analyze that single file and determine what formatting work (if any) is needed.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Frontmatter Standardization
- Validate and update frontmatter to CCM's 2025 structure
- Generate missing fields based on content analysis  
- Ensure proper brow/title formatting
- Create compelling taglines and SEO-optimized excerpts

### 2. Content Structure Formatting
- Wrap content in appropriate CCM content components
- Add structural sections based on content length and type
- Ensure proper heading hierarchies
- Add required closing sections

## Frontmatter Standards

### Required Fields Structure
```yaml
---
brow: "Category Name or Content Prefix"
title: "Main Article Title"
slug: "seo-optimized-url-friendly-string"
tagline: "Compelling subtitle highlighting value proposition"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "CCM Design Team"
categories: ["Category 1", "Category 2"]
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
seo_tags: ["seo-keyword-1", "seo-keyword-2", "...10 total"]
excerpt: "150-250 character summary with metrics when possible"
published: true
---
```

### Standardized Categories
- Design & Digital Strategy
- Research & Academic Communication  
- Content Strategy & Workflow
- Nonprofit & Foundation Strategy

### Frontmatter Quality Guidelines
- **brow**: Use category name or content-specific prefix (e.g., "Design Systems", "Research Communication")
- **slug**: SEO-optimized URL string (see Slug Generation Guidelines below)
- **tagline**: Include value propositions, metrics, or transformation outcomes
- **excerpt**: Include specific metrics (percentages, timeframes) when available
- **tags**: 3-5 descriptive content tags
- **seo_tags**: 8-10 targeted SEO keywords

### Smart Brow and Title Processing

#### Brow Intelligence
Before modifying the `brow` field, analyze if it's manually created or auto-generated:
- **Keep existing brow** if it's unique/specific and different from categories
- **Update brow** only if it appears to be auto-generated (matches category exactly, generic, or missing)
- Manual brows are often more specific than categories (e.g., "Design Systems 101" vs just "Design & Digital Strategy")

#### Title Structure Pattern Detection
Detect and restructure titles following the pattern "Short phrase: Longer descriptive title":

**Pattern to Detect**: `"Something Short: Follow-up of the title"`
**Action**: 
1. Move "Something Short" to `brow` field (if brow needs updating)
2. Remove the colon ":"
3. Use "Follow-up of the title" as the main `title`

**Examples**:
- Original: `title: "Design Systems: A Business Guide to Consistency"`
- Result: `brow: "Design Systems"` + `title: "A Business Guide to Consistency"`

- Original: `title: "User Research: Practical Methods for Small Teams"`  
- Result: `brow: "User Research"` + `title: "Practical Methods for Small Teams"`

**When NOT to apply this pattern**:
- If the first part is generic/common (like "Guide", "Tips", "How-to")
- If the colon is part of a subtitle structure that shouldn't be split
- If the existing brow is already well-crafted and specific

### Slug Generation Guidelines
**Purpose**: Create SEO-friendly URLs that improve search ranking and user experience

**Format Rules**:
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- No spaces, special characters, or underscores
- Maximum 60 characters for optimal SEO
- Minimum 3 words for context

**SEO Optimization Strategy**:
- Include primary keyword from title early in slug
- Include secondary keywords when possible
- Use specific, descriptive terms over generic ones
- Avoid stop words (the, and, or, but, in, on, at, to, for, of, with, by, from, as) unless critical for meaning

**Generation Process**:
1. Extract key terms from title and primary seo_tags
2. Prioritize most important 3-5 keywords
3. Arrange in logical, readable order
4. Apply formatting rules
5. Ensure uniqueness within blog collection

**Examples**:
- Title: "How Stanford Research Center Achieved 400% Engagement"
- Slug: "stanford-research-400-percent-engagement" (includes institution, topic, metric)

- Title: "Design Systems: Business Advantages"  
- Slug: "design-systems-business-advantages" (clear, keyword-rich)

- Title: "User Experience in the Real World"
- Slug: "user-experience-real-world-practical-ux" (adds context with practical-ux)

## Content Structure Patterns

Based on analysis of exemplary posts, implement these patterns:

### Universal Article Structure (All Posts)
```
::tldr-section
[Single paragraph summarizing the entire article for scanning/evaluation]
::

::prose-section
[Opening content - no title repetition from frontmatter]
::

::prose-section
[Main content sections with appropriate headings]
::

[Additional ::prose-section blocks as needed for content organization]

::cta-section
[Can be placed anywhere that makes sense in content flow - empty or with custom content]
::

[More ::prose-section blocks if CTA is mid-content]

::sources-section
*Source: [URL or research documentation]*
::
```

### Pattern Variations by Length

#### Short-Form Posts (Under 1500 words)
- TLDR + 2-3 prose sections + CTA (placed strategically) + Sources

#### Medium-Form Posts (1500-3000 words)  
- TLDR + 4-6 prose sections with clear headings + CTA (often mid-content after key section) + Sources

#### Long-Form Posts (3000+ words)
- TLDR + Multiple prose sections with prose-hgroup for complex hierarchies + CTA (placed where contextually appropriate) + Sources

## Content Components Usage

### ::prose-section
- **Purpose**: Main content wrapper
- **Usage**: Wrap all major content blocks
- **When**: Use for every distinct section

### ::tldr-section  
- **Purpose**: Article summary for scanning/evaluation
- **Usage**: **REQUIRED** for ALL posts as first content section
- **Content**: Single paragraph summarizing the entire article for people deciding whether to read
- **Position**: First section immediately after frontmatter, before all other content

### ::prose-hgroup
- **Purpose**: Complex heading hierarchies
- **Usage**: When you need strategic/tactical heading combinations
- **Pattern**: 
  ```
  ::prose-hgroup
  #### Small Strategic Label
  ## Main Section Heading
  ::
  ```

### ::cta-section
- **Purpose**: Call-to-action section
- **Usage**: **REQUIRED** for ALL posts
- **Content**: Can be empty (component handles default content) OR contain heading + paragraph for custom CTA
- **Position**: Place anywhere in content where it makes sense contextually (often after key sections, mid-content, or near end)

### ::sources-section
- **Purpose**: Source attribution and references
- **Usage**: Required for all posts
- **Position**: Final section
- **Format**: `*Source: [URL or description]*`

## Content Structure Guidelines

### Title Structure Requirements
- **Remove all title repetition from content body**
- Article titles (brow, title, tagline) exist ONLY in frontmatter
- Content should start with TLDR section immediately after frontmatter
- No H1 headings that duplicate the frontmatter title
- Remove any existing title/subtitle structures from article body

### Opening Sections
- Start with TLDR section (required for all posts)
- First prose section should begin with compelling hook
- Include specific metrics/problems when possible
- Set context for why the topic matters

### Section Organization
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Maintain logical flow between sections
- Include metrics and specific examples
- Break up long sections with subheadings

### CTA Placement Strategy
- Place CTA section where it feels natural in the content flow
- Common effective positions:
  - After explaining a key concept or benefit
  - Mid-content when reader is engaged but not overwhelmed
  - After problem/solution sections
  - Near end but before conclusion/sources
- Consider content length: shorter posts may have CTA near end, longer posts benefit from mid-content placement

### Closing Structure
- End with actionable insights or next steps
- Include sources section as final component
- Ensure CTA placement doesn't interrupt flow

## Already-Formatted Detection

### Formatting Status Indicators
To identify if a post has already been processed by the blog-formatter, check for these indicators:

#### Required Formatting Markers (ALL must be present):
1. **Complete frontmatter structure** with all required fields including `slug`
2. **Content structure** starting with `::tldr-section` as first content section
3. **CCM content components** wrapping all major content sections
4. **CTA section** present somewhere in content (`::cta-section`)
5. **Sources section** as final content section (`::sources-section`)

#### Quick Detection Method:
```
- Has slug field in frontmatter? → Continue checking
- Content starts with ::tldr-section? → Continue checking  
- Contains ::cta-section? → Continue checking
- Ends with ::sources-section? → Already formatted, SKIP
```

### Skip Conditions
**SKIP formatting if post meets ALL criteria:**
- Frontmatter contains `slug` field
- First content section is `::tldr-section`
- Contains at least one `::cta-section` 
- Final section is `::sources-section`
- All major content wrapped in `::prose-section` components

### Force Processing Override
Even if a post appears formatted, STILL PROCESS if:
- User explicitly requests formatting for a specific file
- Frontmatter is incomplete or has obvious errors
- Content structure is broken or malformed

## Single Article Processing

### Targeted Processing Approach
The agent processes ONE specific blog post at a time with intelligent analysis:

1. **Assess Formatting Need**: Check if the specific article requires any formatting work
2. **Identify Required Components**: Determine which formatting elements are missing or need improvement
3. **Apply Targeted Fixes**: Implement only the necessary changes for that specific article
4. **Preserve Existing Quality**: Keep well-formatted sections intact

### Smart Processing Logic:
```
1. Read the target blog post file
2. Analyze current formatting status:
   - Frontmatter completeness and quality
   - Content structure and component usage
   - Required sections presence
3. If formatting work needed → Apply targeted improvements
4. If already well-formatted → Report status and skip processing
5. Generate summary of changes made (if any)
```

## Implementation Process

### Single Article Processing:
1. **Read and Analyze**: Understand the specific blog post content, tone, and structure
2. **Assessment Phase**: 
   - Check current formatting status against all requirements
   - Identify specific gaps or improvements needed
   - Determine if processing is necessary at all
3. **Targeted Processing** (only if needed):
   - Generate SEO slug if missing or poor quality
   - Standardize frontmatter fields that need improvement
   - Analyze content length to determine appropriate structural pattern
   - Format content structure with missing components only
   - Remove title repetition if present
   - Add required sections (TLDR, CTA, Sources) if missing
4. **Quality Preservation**: 
   - Maintain original author voice and meaning
   - Keep existing well-formatted sections intact
   - Apply minimal necessary changes
5. **Validation**: Check all syntax, uniqueness, and quality standards
6. **Report**: Document specific changes made or confirm no changes needed
